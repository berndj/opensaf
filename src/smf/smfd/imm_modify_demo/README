DEMO AND TEST PROGRAMS
----------------------

To use the demo and test programs in this directory the following has to be
fulfilled:
- The IMM demo-class as defined in democlass.xml must be installed in
  /usr/local/share/opensaf/immxml/services/

Building the demo and test programs:
------------------------------------
- The programs will be built and installed if --enable-tests is used with the
  automake configure script
- The democlass.xml file will be installed if --enable-immxml is used with the
  automeke configure script
Example: ./configure --enable-tests --enable-immxml <other options>

Running demo programs:
----------------------
The demo programs are made in such a way that they can be run in the following
order:
1. ccbdemo_create
   Creates two objects of the demo class. The first object has parent
   safApp=safSmfService and the other has no parent meaning it is a root object.
   The first object demonstrates filling in all attribute types with multi
   value.
2. ccbdemo_modify
   Demonstrates modifying some of the attributes in the first object created in
   1.
3. ccbdemo_delete
   Demonstrates deletion of the objects created in 1.

The demo programs prints out the name of the demo class and the names of the
objects that are created. This makes it easy to use cut and paste together
with immlist and immfind to check the results

Running the test program:
-------------------------
Test the immccb handler:
$ test_ccbhdl

The test program is interactive. It runs a sequence prints out what has been
done and suggests what the user should verify and stops execution. Execution
continues with a new step when the user press Enter

The test program executes a number of CCB operations on order to test:
- All operations
- Several operations of the same type and of different types in the same CCB
- Using the IMM model modifier (se immccb.h in .../imm_modify_config/) in
  different scopes e.g.
  - Create a modifier object and use it once and let it go out of scope
  - Create a modifier object that is reused to create and apply several CCBs

Test SmfUtils_ObjExist:

$ test_objexist

This test is dependent on that democlass.xml is installed. This will be done
if --enable-tests and --enable-immxml is used with the ./configure script
