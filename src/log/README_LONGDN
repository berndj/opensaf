I. GENERAL INFORMATION (#1315)
==============================

The SaNameT type, which is used to pass distinguished stream DNs name in
saLogStreamOpen_2() API, or in `logSvcUsrName`, `notificationObject` or
`notifyingObject` which belong to `SaLogRecordT` data structure passed to
`saLogWriteLogAsync()` API, contains a fixed-size buffer that limits the string
length to a maximum of 255 bytes.

#1315 ticket was raised for LOG to support long DN. The use cases could be:
UC1) Write a log record having the long DN at @Sl, @No, @Ng tokens
     using Log APIs.
UC2) Create a long app stream name using Log API.
UC3) Write a log record to a long app stream name using saflogger tool.

The ticket included following parts:
1) Update saflogger tool - add one more option `-f`
2) Update LOG agent (API) to support Long DN
3) Update LOG service to support Long DN
4) Create test cases


II) IMPLEMENTATION (#1315)
==============================

1) saflogger Tool - Option `-f`
-------------------------------------------------

Refer to `~/osaf/tools/saflog/saflogger/README` for information.


2) LOG Agent
---------------------------------------------

All internal SaNameT are replaced by SaConstStringT and functions handling
extended SaNameT are used.

With extended SaNameT, data size now is up to 2048(kOsafMaxDnLength) bytes (not
limited to 256 bytes any more). All max data size checking against 256 bytes
are revised - now limited to 2048(kOsafMaxDnLength) bytes.  Due to this point,
one notice is that, when supported long DN client (e.g: log client running on
OpenSAF 5.1 or newer versions) sends an record containing long data (e.g:
`notificationObject` length > 256 bytes) to active Log service which is not
support long DN (e.g: active log running on OpenSAF 5.0 or older versions), that
log client will get `SA_AIS_ERR_TRY_AGAIN` always and may cause the log client
hang. There is no problem with the opposite case (non-support long DN does
communicate with supported long DN).

Is there any impacts on LOG APIs (except above case)? No.

Note:
If the application wants to use long DN support, few things have to be
done. Refer to chapter 4 of OpenSAF_Extensions_PR.odt for details.


3) LOG Service
----------------------------------------

Logsv used Maps as an database to hold all
existing LOG stream names, and taking stream name as the keyword for
searching/adding/deleting elements.


Beside that map, logsv is providing other database named `stream_array` which
is used to hold all LOG existing streams. When there is any new stream created,
a new `log_stream_t` object is created. It holds information of that stream.
It later is added to that database. And when the stream is closed and no client
connects to that stream, it will be removed from the database.
That database is a two-dimensional array with data format:

	{
		{ <streamId1>, <pointer to `log_stream_t`> },
		{ <streamId2>, <pointer to `log_stream_t`> },
		...
	}

Logsv is able to query below infos from `stream_array` that logsv used to do
based on Maps:
- Is there any current log stream with specific DN in system?
- Or what are the current log existing streams in system?
`stream_array` database can play the same role as Maps. 

More on `stream_array` database. All rooms in `stream_array` is clean/reset at
startup. First three rooms are reserved for well-known streams.
At the moment (OpenSAF 5.1), there are total 67 rooms (64 for app streams + 3
for well-known streams). Adding/deleting/searching items to/from this database
is fast.

Besides, all internal SaNameT are replaced by SaConstStringT or C++ strings and
functions handling extended SaNameT are used.

Notes:
When active logsv on OpenSAF 5.1 or newer communicates with older version such
as LOG client on OpenSAF 5.0 (not support Long DN). If there is any operation
on creating long app stream name and long DN is enabled in IMM, standby node
will be crashed.  This happens because active logs sends checkpoint data to
standby node, and standby log copies data using `strcpy()` to non-extended
SaNameT type (size is limited to 255 bytes). Make the data
overflowed. `strcpy()` should not be used anywhere in code, `strncpy()` instead.

To avoid this happens, two options:
a) During upgrade, disable long DN in IMM or make sure there is no long DN
operation run until the upgrade is finished.
b) Raise one ticket to fix all
places using strcpy()


4) Test Cases
-----------------------------
Refer to `~/tests/logsv/README` for information.
