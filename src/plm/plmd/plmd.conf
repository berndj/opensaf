# Uncomment the next line if you want to run plms through valgrind
#export PLMSTOOL="valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=/tmp/plms.valgrind"

# Uncomment the next line to enable trace

# Setting OPENSAF_PLMS_CLUSTERAUTO_SCALE to a script or executable will enable
# support for automatic cluster scaling in PLM. Currently, only scale-out is
# supported. When automatic cluster scaling is enabled, the PLM service will
# call the script defined here with one or more command-line arguments, where
# each argument is a comma-separated list of properties of a node that wishes to
# join the cluster. This script/executable should add the necessary IMM objects
# for the new node(s). See the README file of the PLM service for more
# information.
# export OPENSAF_PLMS_CLUSTERAUTO_SCALE=/usr/bin/plm_scale_out
