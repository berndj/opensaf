#
# plmcd.conf
#
# This is the plmcd.conf file.  It should be customized for use on your
# individual cluster nodes.  Normally, this file resides in /etc/opensaf,
# but the location may be specified in the OpenSAF script.conf file.
# See the PLMc scripts directory for details on how to set up a custom
# location. 
#
# Please note well: The plmcd.conf file has a tag for the ee_id.
# This ee_id must be unique for the given cluster node.
# If the ee_id value is duplicated across cluster nodes, the
# PLMc library will not function correctly.
#
# Also note that currently we are not trimming off any white space
# for the values. Take extra care of making sure you don't put 
# trailing white space anywhere.
#

#
# ee_id: The ee_id is used to identify the execution environment. It must match
# with the configuration in IMM. Note that the ee_id must be unique for the 
# execution environment. If you have several execution environments with the same
# ee_id the result is undefined.
# Mandatory

# plmc_msg_protocol_version: This is used to identify the capabilities of the
# running plmc.
# Mandatory
[plmc_msg_protocol_version]

#
# controller_1_ip: This is used by plmc to know how to contact the primary 
# PLMSv
# Mandatory
[controller_1_ip]
10.105.1.3

#
# controller_2_ip: This is used by plmc to know how to contact the secondary
# if you want to use just one controller set this the the same IP address
# as for controller_1_ip
# Mandatory
[controller_2_ip]

#
# services: Each line will be a command to start a service that 
# should be managed by PLM. The services will be started in the order they
# are listed here
# Also note that you will need to manually remove any references to these
# init scripts in the rc directories for OpenSAF to fully control the
# startup and stop of the services
# If using systemd this should be the service name (e.g. snmpd.service)
# instead of the SysVInit script
# Optional
[services]

#
# osaf: This is the full path to the script, and action, to start
# OpenSAF (/etc/init.d/opensafd start). If you don't want to run OpenSAF
# on this node, you can put (/bin/echo foobar) instead
# Note that on a controller there should still be references to the
# /etc/init.d/opensafd script in the rc directories for the service to 
# startup initially. Without this OpenSAF will never start
# If using systemd this should be the service name (e.g. opensafd.service)
# instead of the SysVInit script
# Optional

# os_type: This is a description of the OS. Currently it needs to follow 
# the following syntax, 1;os;Fedora;2.6.31, where 
# 1 => Version
# os => Product
# Fedora => Vendor
# 2.6.31 => Release
# Note that Version is mandatory while the other fields can be empty

# plmc_cmd_timeout_secs:  This is the time plmc should be allowed to wait

# within this time plmc will send a timeout message to PLMSv
