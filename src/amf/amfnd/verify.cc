  Name          : avnd_evt_avd_verify_message

  Description   : This routine processes the data verify message sent by newly
                  Active AVD.

  Arguments     : cb  - ptr to the AvND control block
                  evt - ptr to the AvND event

  Return Values : NCSCC_RC_SUCCESS/NCSCC_RC_FAILURE

  Notes         : None.
