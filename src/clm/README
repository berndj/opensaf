GENERAL
CLMSv is an implementation of the SAF-AIS-CLM-B.04.01 specifications.

This document provides an overview of the design and internals of the CLMSv.
The CLMSv service is implemented as the following modules:
	* CLMS - The Cluster Membership Server
	* CLMNA - The Cluster Membership Node Agent
	* CLMA - The Cluster Membership Agent

The CLMS server is implemented as a server process running on the OpenSAF
controller nodes in a 2N redundancy model.

The CLMNA is an CLM node agent process that gets started on every node during
OpenSAF node startup. The CLMNA fetches the saClmNode(node name)of the local node,
the saClmNodeID(/etc/opensaf/node_id a "run time" attribute) 
of the saClmNode class) and updates the CLMS.
The CLMNA is modelled as component in a NoRedundancy Model with error recovery
as NodeFailFast.

OpenSAF 4.4 provides support for saClmNodeAddressFamily and saClmNodeAddress
attributes when TCP is chosen as the mode of transport.
These attributes shall represent the ipaddress and ipaddressfamily
configured(in dtmd.conf) for a member node when TCP is used for OpenSAF
communication.
NOTES:
- Currently, It shall be the responsibility of the user to 
ensure that they use/configure the 'same ipaddress values' in dtmd.conf and in the imm.xml.
i.e. CLM shall not attempt to validate them in 4.4.

- When user chooses TIPC as mode of transport, then the address length will be
set to 0 and address family shall contain the default value of 
SA_CLM_AF_INET.
This is done for backward compatibility with pre OpenSAF 4.4 libraries
and also because the CLM spec does not support any value other than 
SA_CLM_AF_INET(i.e. for IPv4) and SA_CLM_AF_INET6 
(i.e. for IPv6).

The CLMA is the clm agent library that user applications shall link with.


SCALE OUT

The scale-out feature makes it possible to run a customizable script when a node
which is not configured in IMM tries to join the cluster. The intention is that
the script will check if the new node is eligible to be added to the cluster,
and if so add the necessary IMM objects so that the node will be able to join
the next time it tries. The script will be called with one or more command-line
arguments, where each argument is a comma-separated list of properties of a node
that wishes to join the cluster. The comma separator can be changed by
setting variable CLMNA_IFS in clmna.conf to use another field separator, the
field separator is passed in environment variable CLM_IFS to the
opensaf_scale_out script.
Currently, the comma-separated list in each command-line argument contains
four entries, node-id, node-name, node-ipaddress, user-data.
But the script should be forwards compatible with future extensions where more
entries may be added to the comma-separated list. The first entry in the list
is the node id represented as a decimal number. The second entry in the list is
the name of the node. The third entry is the IP address of the node. The fourth
entry is optional user data that can be entered in a file named
/etc/opensaf/clm_user_data, up to 255 characters can be given.

NOTE: the script must be idempotent, i.e. it must be harmless to call it more
than one time with the same parameters. The second call should do nothing since
the nodes were added to the cluster the first time the script was called.

To enable the scale-out feature in CLM, set the variable
OPENSAF_CLUSTERAUTO_SCALE_ENABLED in nid.conf to the value 1. You must also
customize the script $pkglibdir/opensaf_scale_out so that it adds the IMM
objects needed necessary for the node to join the cluster.
