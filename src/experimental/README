This directory contains experimental OpenSAF code and new features that are not
yet considered to be fully mature, and thus not recommended for use in a
production environment. They are provided as "technology preview" or for beta
testing to anyone who might be interested. If and when a feature is considered
mature, it will be moved out of the experimental directory into the regular
OpenSAF source code tree.

By default, the experimental code is not built. To build the experimental code
in this directory and its subdirectories, you must provide the
--enable-experimental option to the OpenSAF configure script.

When adding new code into the experimental directory, please use an appropriate
subdirectory under the experimental directory, so that unrelated features are
not mixed in the same directory.
