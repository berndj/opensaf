This directory contains the 4.5 release of `OpenSAF'.

`OpenSAF' is an open source project designed to implement a complete highly
available operating environment based on Service Availability Forum (SA Forum)
standards. The objective of the `OpenSAF' project is to accelerate broad adoption
of a SA Forum compliant operating environment. OpenSAF also offers
complementary services which are required in a complete high-availability
system solution.

`OpenSAF' has been originally contributed by Motorola ECC, by open sourcing
its HA middleware suite Netplane Core Services (NCS).

`OpenSAF' has a web site at http://opensaf.sourceforge.net/

`OpenSAF' Architecture Overview
===============================

`OpenSAF' software is distributed in nature. There is a Controller node, which is
the central entity in the cluster which will control all the other Payload nodes
in the HA cluster. In the HA cluster there are two System Controllers running in
Active/Standby mode.

The `OpenSAF' software is divided in to following classes of Modules:

    * Directors:
      The Service directors run on the Controller node. They interact with
      Node Directors running on the Payload nodes and provide service specific
      functionality.

    * Node Directors:
      Node directors distribute the service responsibilities with directors.
      Node directors interact with Agents to provide service functionality to
      the user applications. Node directors run both on System Controller node
      and Payload nodes.

    * Servers:
      Servers run on the System Controller and they talk to Agents to provide
      service functionality to the users. If the service is having servers then
      it doesn't have directors, node director pieces. If the service doesn't
      have node local functionality then "Server - Agent" architectural approach
      is used.

    * Agents: Agents are the service libraries which are linked with user
      applications and provide service to the user applications by interacting
      with other service parts.

User applications can run on either System Controller node or Payload node. But
it is advisable to run the user applications on the Payload nodes, so your
applications are not impacted when System Controller failover happens due to
any failures in `OpenSAF' Modules.

The OpenSAF infrastructure is made highly available by modeling the individual
services as AMF components. All the Node Directors use no redundancy model and
are restart capable with component capability 1_ACTIVE. All the Directors and
Servers use 2N redundancy model with "1_ACTIVE_OR_1_STANDBY".

By default (in 4.2) OpenSAF processes will run as the UNIX system user "opensaf"
which is a member of the "opensaf" UNIX group. Only two processes are running
as root, amfnd and smfnd. Reason is that amfnd need todo that for backwards 
compatible reasons and the programs it starts might be designed to require root
access. The reason for smfnd for running as root is that it typically installs
rpms which requires root access. The rpms built by opensaf will create these users
using rpm scriptlets.

When using a "make install" system, either manually do the same as the rpm post
install scriptlet (create group and user, configure sudo etc) or configure
opensaf to run as root.

See the build section how to revert to old all root behaviour.

Prerequisites
=============

The following software is required to build OpenSAF:

    * libxml2-dev (Development files for the GNOME XML library)
    * automake
    * m4
    * autoconf (2.61 or later)
    * libtool
    * pkg-config
    * gcc/g++
    * GNU make
    * python-dev(el)
    * Optionally:
        * The Linux Kernel with TIPC development support. This is required when opensaf is 
	  built with the option --enable-tipc. OpenSAF works with TIPC version 1.5 onwards. But it 
	  is strongly adviced to use TIPC 1.6.2 and above to get the TIPC service unsubscribe 
	  feature(Cancellation to a Subscription).

        * When PLM is enabled, an HPI implementation (e.g. OpenHPI)
        * When IMM PBE feature is enabled, sqlite3

    If enabling optional Java support:
        - A Java 1.5+ capable JDK (e.g. OpenJDK 1.6)
        - Apache Ant

If a specific prerequisite package revision isn't working for you, please
let us know about it following the instructions from the Bug Reporting section.


Building `OpenSAF'
==================

Some features needs to be configured at build time but don't have configure
support, these are explained here.

1) Configure a non flat MDS addressing scheme (optional) when TIPC is chosen
as the transport

In the default (from 4.3) addressing scheme, TIPC node addresses looks like
1.1.1, 1.1.2 etc.

To re-enable the old (pre 4.3) non flat addressing, configure the constant
MDS_USE_SUBSLOT_ID=1 at configure time as in:

    % ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DMDS_USE_SUBSLOT_ID=1 ..."

In the non flat scheme, the slot ID is shifted up 4 bits and subslot ID is 
added in the 4 LSB. The consequence of this is reduced number of
addressable TIPC nodes in the cluster. This scheme is more likely to be used
in xTCA type of systems and produces node addresses like 1.1.31, 1.1.47 etc.

More configuration is needed, see nid.conf in 00-README.conf


2) Run as root (optional)

If the old (<4.2) behaviour of running all processes as root is desired, use
the following configure command:

    % ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DRUNASROOT


3) Configure TIPC importance (optional)

The default TIPC importance is LOW for all services except for AVND which is HIGH.
In some cases the default importance must be changed if e.g. an application starves the LOW importance communication level.
To change the default importance, use the following configure command

   % ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DTIPCIMPORTANCE=level
   where level is any of TIPC_LOW_IMPORTANCE, TIPC_MEDIUM_IMPORTANCE or TIPC_HIGH_IMPORTANCE
   e.g. configure CPPFLAGS=-DTIPCIMPORTANCE=TIPC_HIGH_IMPORTANCE

Note: Giving same importance to AVND & all other Opensaf models is not preferred option. The behavior is unsupported.


4) Configure GCC hardening options (optional)

By default, the options "-fstack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2" are passed to
GCC for improved security. You can override these options by setting the
OSAF_HARDEN_FLAGS when configuring OpenSAF. For example:

   % ./configure OSAF_HARDEN_FLAGS="-fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2"

If you are using a released archive (dist tarball) follow the simple common
steps:

    % ./configure && make

    OR

    % ./configure && make rpm

Note: `OpenSAF' can safely be built with parallel jobs using -jX, where X
      should be the number of CPU you want to dedicate + 1

If you are Building from `Mercurial', make sure you followed the required
steps before trying to `configure' (i.e. bootsrapping).

    % ./bootstrap.sh
    % ./configure && make
    OR
    % ./configure && make rpm

By default, OpenSAF is built with TCP as the transport.

By default, all 'OpenSAF' services are enabled to be built and
`OpenSAF' will assume the following `configure' options by default:

    --disable-java --disable-imm-pbe --disable-tests

Some OpenSAF services/features can be disabled through configure options.
To alter the default configure options, the following configure options 
are available w.r.t enabling/disabling the build for a particular OpenSAF service:
(The below options can also be known from  the command  % ./configure --help)

                          global revision (ARG=global-rev); set the RPM
                          release value to be the local revision
                          (ARG=local-rev); set the RPM release value to be
                          <val> (ARG=<val>, [default=1])
  --with-hpi-interface=[ARG]
                          autodetect the SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION (ARG=check
                          [default]); set the SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION to
                          A.01.01 (ARG=A01); set the SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION
                          to B.01.01 (ARG=B01); set the
                          SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION to B.02.01 (ARG=B02); set
                          the SAHPI_INTERFACE_VERSION to B.03.01 (ARG=B03)
  --with-initscriptdir=[DIR]
                          use DIR as the directory containing the init.d
                          scripts. [default=/etc/init.d]
  --with-pic              try to use only PIC/non-PIC objects [default=use
                          both]
  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
  --with-jdk=DIR          use JDK from DIR
  --with-ant=DIR          Use ant from DIR

Use one of the following forms to enable an option:

    --with-<mumble>        OR --enable-<mumble>
    --with-<mumble>=yes		OR	--enable-<mumble>=yes
    --without-<mumble>=no	OR	--disable-<mumble>=no

For eg:- To enable building the IMM PBE feature, use the following option:

    % ./configure --enable-imm-pbe

Use one of the following forms to disable an option:

    --without-<mumble>		OR	--disable-<mumble>
    --without-<mumble>=yes	OR	--disable-<mumble>=yes
    --with-<mumble>=no		OR	--enable-<mumble>=no

For eg:- To disable building the LOCK service, use the following option:

     % ./configure --disable-ais-lck

The `--with-<mumble>' option forms are used for external package support and
the `--enable-<mumble>' option forms are used for internal component state.

Note: When PLM is enabled, `OpenSAF' relies on <SaHpi.h>, even if
the user thinks he's not using a specific HPI implementation. This is a build
dependency and the user still needs to tell the build system to  be
using the proper CPPFLAGS/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS where to find a dummy <SaHpi.h>

By using `./configure --enable-tipc', you are building OpenSAF to support TIPC 
also as the transport. Upon enabling this option, the OpenSAF binaries
support both TIPC and TCP as the transport and to use TIPC, you have to 
change the variable MDS_TRANSPORT to TIPC in the 
nid.conf file (see nid.conf in 00-README.conf). By choosing this option
you have the flexibility to change from using tipc to tcp without having
to rebuild.

By using `./configure --enable-java', you are enabling the Java AIS mapping
support in the build system. Specials M4 macros will be used to autodetect
what `JDK' and `Ant' program you are using. By default this options is
disabled.

By using `./configure --with-jdk=DIR', you can force the build system to use
a specific JDK installed in a non-standard location on your system.

By using `./configure --with-ant=DIR', you can force the build system to use
a specific Ant version installed in a non-standard location on your system.

By using `./configure --with-rpm-release', you can change the default release
token in the generated rpm filename. Predefined values exist like the build
timestamp, the Mercurial revision used to when building the code, and also you
can add your own free text token.

By using `./configure --with-hpi-interface', you can force the HPI interface
version used. By default it's autodetected by scanning the SaHpi.h header, but
when cross-compiling is used it's not possible to run the test code for that
autodetection.

By using `./configure --disable-rpm-target', you are masking out the `make rpm'
target, some build systems provide their own `make rpm` rule, it would then be
clashing with the OpenSAF rule.


Building `OpenSAF' RPMs
=======================

As shown in the Building `OpenSAF' section, generating RPMs can be done using:

    % ./configure && make rpm

The special `make rpm' target will generate a dist archive, create the
`OpenSAF' SRPM using the opensaf.spec file, and finally launch the rpmbuild
process. You can find the generated RPMs under `./rpms/RPMS/<build_arch>/':

RPMs per OpenSAF Service are generated. For eg:-

* opensaf-<svcname-director>-<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm:
  RPM containing the particular OpenSAF service director/server's binaries,
  libraries, CLC scripts, and the immxml classes and objects owned/implemented by the service.

* opensaf-<svcname-nodedirector>-<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm:
  RPM containing the particular OpenSAF service NodeDirector's binaries, CLC
  scripts.

* opensaf-<svcname-libs>-<version>.<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm:
  RPM containing the particular OpenSAF service libraries to be linked by User
  and any User Program (command line tool/utility) provided the service.

With the default configure options, the following RPMs are generated:

opensaf-<Release>.<arch>.rpm
opensaf-controller-<Release>.<arch>.rpm
opensaf-devel-<Release>.<arch>.rpm
opensaf-samples-<Release>.<arch>.rpm

Installing `OpenSAF'
====================

`OpenSAF' can be installed in several ways. When doing development, a
user might prefer using the classic `make install' way to using RPMs.
It can be achieved like this:

    % make install

    OR

    % make install DESTDIR=<staged_install_directory>

After installing `OpenSAF' you will need to run `ldconfig' because `OpenSAF'
places internal libs in the `$pkglibdir' (e.g. /usr/lib/opensaf/). This ldconfig
operation is handled automatically by using rpm installation.

In production systems, RPMs should be preferred to classic `make install`.

To setup a development environment for a given OpenSAF service, install following RPMs:
    % rpm -ivh opensaf-<svc_name>-libs-<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm
    % rpm -ivh opensaf-devel-<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm
    % rpm -ivh opensaf-samples-<Release>.<build_arch>.rpm

If Java AIS mapping was enabled, install the following RPM:

    % rpm -ivh opensaf-java-<version>.<build_arch>.rpm

If you are installing `OpenSAF' from a supported `yum' server, it will resolve
the proper dependencies for you:

    % yum install opensaf-controller

    OR

    % yum install opensaf-payload

Here is where individual `OpenSAF' components get installed:

    * Documentation: `$docdir' (e.g /usr/share/doc/packages/opensaf/)
    * Samples, Templates: `$pkgdatadir'/samples (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/samples)
    * IMM XML Merge tool: `pkgimmxmldir' (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/samples/immxml
    * SAF libraries: `$libdir' (e.g. /usr/lib/)
    * SAF headers: `$includedir' (e.g. /usr/include/)
    * Configuration: `$pkgsysconfdir' (e.g. /etc/opensaf/)
    * OpenSAF headers: `$pkgincludedir' (e.g. /usr/include/opensaf/)
    * Runtime Misc.: `$pkglocalstate' (e.g. /var/lib/opensaf/)
    * OpenSAF internals(binaries,clc-scripts): `$pkglibdir' (e.g. /usr/lib/opensaf/)
    * User programs: `$bindir' (e.g. /usr/bin/)
    * SysV scripts: `$sysconfdir/init.d/' (e.g. /etc/init.d/)
    * Logs: `$localstatedir/log/opensaf' (e.g. /var/log/opensaf/)
    * PID: `$localstatedir/run/opensaf/' (e.g. /var/run/opensaf/)



Linking with `OpenSAF' AIS Services
===================================

`OpenSAF' provides `pkgconfig' files for each AIS services.
These files are installed with the other system `*.pc' files
in `$(libdir)/pkgconfig':

   * opensaf-amf.pc
   * opensaf-ckpt.pc
   * opensaf-clm.pc
   * opensaf-evt.pc
   * opensaf-imm.pc
   * opensaf-lck.pc
   * opensaf-log.pc
   * opensaf-msg.pc
   * opensaf-ntf.pc
   * opensaf-plm.pc


There are two easy ways to use `pkgconfig'. The first one is to call it directly
from a `Makefile' and assign its content to make variables e.g.:

   AMF_LIBS=`pkg-config opensaf-amf --libs`
   AMF_CFLAGS=`pkg-config opensaf-amf --cflags`

Or if your application is using the `GNU Build System' with `autotools', you can
use a special `autoconf' macro provided by `pkgconfig' e.g.:

   -- in configure.ac --
   PKG_CHECK_MODULES(AMF, opensaf-amf)

It will then provides two special variables available to `automake':

   -- in Makefile.am --
   mumble_CFLAGS = @AMF_CFLAGS@
   mumble_LDADD = @AMF_LIBS@


How to Configure `OpenSAF'
==========================

See file `00-README.conf' for the configuration file syntax/format.

How to Run `OpenSAF'
====================
When PLM is enabled, The 'plmcd' SysV init script is installed in 
`$sysconfdir/rc.d/init.d' (e.g. /etc/rc.d/init.d/) directory.

The `OpenSAF' SysV init script is installed in `$sysconfdir/rc.d/init.d'
(e.g. /etc/rc.d/init.d/)

Commands to Start OpenSAF When PLM is disabled:
===============================================
After a minimum configuration of
 - slot_id, nodeinit.conf.controller, node_name, imm.xml(Generated) and configure_tipc(if needbe), for the controller 
  (OR)
 - slot_id, nodeinit.conf.payload and node_name, for the payload.

the following command shall start the OpenSAF services:

% /etc/init.d/opensafd start [start|stop|status]

Commands to Start OpenSAF When PLM is enabled:
==============================================
After a minimum configuration of 

 - slot_id, nodeinit.conf.controller, node_name, imm.xml(Generated) and configure_tipc(if needbe) and the plmcd.conf, 
   for the controller
  (OR)
 - slot_id, nodeinit.conf.payload, node_name and the plmcd.conf, for the payload

The following commands shall be executed:

% /etc/init.d/plmcd start

% /etc/init.d/opensafd start [start|stop|status]

Note: Its not necessary to start OpenSAF if an entry to start OpenSAF is
set/specified in the plmcd.conf file.

More TODO on status command.

Command To Trigger a Administrative Switchover of the Controller Nodes:
=======================================================================
amf-adm si-swap safSi=SC-2N,safApp=OpenSAF

Building `OpenSAF' Samples
==========================

The sources of the `OpenSAF' sample applications will get installed in
`$pkgdatadir/samples' (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/samples/).

The following steps shall be done to build the sample applications:
    % ./bootstrap.sh
    % ./configure
    % make
      OR
    % make install

The `Makefile' looks for installed `SAF AIS' headers and `OpenSAF' libs in
standard system wide locations (e.g. /usr/include/ & /usr/lib/):

    INCLUDES = -I.
    LDFLAGS = -lSaAmf

If you have `OpenSAF' development packages installed somewhere else, override
the default values e.g.:

    % make INCLUDES="-I. -I/tmp/usr/local/include" \
        LDFLAGS="-L/tmp/usr/local/lib -lSaAmf -lopensaf_core"

To run an application you will need a configured `OpenSAF' node running.

See file `00-README.samples' for more information on each of the application.


Using the Simulation Environment
================================

See file `00-README.uml' for more information about User Mode Linux and `OpenSAF'

Upgrading OpenSAF
=================
In OpenSAF 4.2, the non-standard DTSv (Distributed Tracing Service) has been retired/removed.
Fresh installations (new users) of 4.2 shall generate a new 
imm.xml(see file 00-README.conf).

Users of OpenSAF 4.0.2 or OpenSAF 4.1.1 releases, who wish to perform an In-Service Upgrade
to OpenSAF 4.2 using SMF based upgrade campaigns should do the following:

1) Download OpenSAF 4.2 release source tar from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensaf/files/releases/
2) Apply the patch 4.2_upgrade_dummydtsv.patch from http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensaf/files/
<FIXME: Patch name, link>
3) Build OpenSAF 4.2 rpms
4) Execute your SMF upgrade campaigns.

The capability to modify the OpenSAF services' information model at run time
has been added now in OpenSAF 4.2 and also in maintenance changesets of
the 4.0.2 and 4.1.1 releases.
You should track this section for information on steps to be done to permenantly delete
the DTSv from the information model, in future releases.

Note: When an OpenSAF installation(< 4.2) running with 'root' privileges and that may have 
configured IMM persistent storage and/or contains old/generated  trace files, 
is now being upgraded to OpenSAF 4.2 as the 'opensaf' user (i.e. non-root user), 
Then it is the responsibility of the user/integrator to manage (through rpm scriptlets 
or upgrade scripts) the permissions of the file/directory of the 
immsv persistent store (see IMMSV_PBE_FILE in the $pkgsysconfdir/immnd.conf. 
e.g. /etc/opensaf/immnd.conf file) and/or the permissions of any previous trace files 
present under the $pkglogdir (e.g. /var/log/opensaf) directory, accordingly, if applicable.

In OpenSAF 4.3, some new configuration attributes have been added to the SMF 
configuration class. To make it possible to use these new attributes the new 
class description needs to be added using the IMM schema change support. 
This can be done after the 4.3 OpenSAF release have been activated.
 
1) Enable the schema change support in the IMM: 
immadm -o 1 -p opensafImmNostdFlags:SA_UINT32_T:1 opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService

2) Read in the new class descriptions : 
immcfg --ignore-duplicates -f /usr/share/opensaf/immxml/services/smfsv_classes.xml
 
3) Disable the schema change support in the IMM:  
immadm -o 2 -p opensafImmNostdFlags:SA_UINT32_T:1 opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService


Admin Operations on OpenSAF SUs
===============================
From OpenSAF release 4.4 onwards, the AMF admin operations lock, lock-in,
unlock, unlock-in is allowed to be performed on the OpenSAF SUs (i.e.
safSu=<nodename>,safSg=2N,safApp=OpenSAF
safSu=<nodename>,safSg=NoRed,safApp=OpenSAF)
However, these commands should be restrictively used, like running them
from a SMF campaign.  When running this from an SMF campaign,
OpenSAF shall support the behaviour only when used under
the supported usecases of OpenSAF. At this point of time,
there is no evident usecase to support this.

Linux Distro-Specific Notes
===========================

`OpenSAF' is known to run on the following Linux installations:

    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4)
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 (RHEL5)
    * Wind River Platform for Network Equipment, Linux Edition (PNE-LE)
    * MontaVista Carrier Grade Edition 4.0
    * Fedora Core 9
    * SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP2
