                      --- Java AIS API for Opensaf ---

1. Introduction

  The Java AIS API for OpenSAF provides the programming interfaces for Java
  developers to access the AIS services. Currently provided interfaces are:
   - AMF - Availability Management Framework version B.01.01.
   - CLM - Cluster Membership version B.01.01

2. Prerequisites

  Java2SE JDK 1.5 or higher for compilation, JRE for execution
  Ant
  JUnit 3.2.8 - junit.jar provided with the package

3. Directory structure

  ais_api        - the SA Forum Java AIS interfaces
  ais_api_impl   - implementation of the interfaces
  ais_api_native - the native binding library between OpenSAF and the Java
                   applications
  ais_api_test   - tests

4. Installation

  Step 1. Compile and install OpenSAF
    OpenSAF needs to be configured with the "--enable-java" option.
    Follow the instructions in the OpenSAF INSTALL file to compile and install it.
    The artifacts created are the following:
        - ais_api_impl/bin/opensaf_ais_api.jar - archive containing the compiled
        AIS Java API and the OpenSAF implementation.
        - ais_api_impl_native/.libs/libjava_ais_api_native.so.x.x.x - the native binding
        library
    These files get installed with the distribution (rpm or make install).
    
  Step 2. Build the test project
    Currently the test project is not compiled with the Java interfaces.
    Go to the ais_api_test directory.
    Issue "ant build-jar".
    If the command succeeds, the opensaf_ais_api_test.jar. This file contains the
    AIS interfaces, the OpenSAF implementation and the test classes.
    
5. Running the tests

5.1  Preparation
  
    After building the test project jar file, go to the configandscript dir.
    Execute the following steps:
        sh gendeploypack.sh
        sudo sh installjtests.sh
    The last step is needed to be executed as root because the script copies files to 
    the /opt/aistest by default. If you need a different target directory, the scripts
    can be parameterized as follows:
    
       gendeploypack.sh [install_dir] [deploy_pack_dir]
           install_dir - the directory where the application is installed. This
           will be the same on all nodes of the cluster and needs to be an
           absolute path. Default: /opt/aistest
           deploy_pack_dir - directory where the current deployment is stored.
           The install script uses this directory as source. Default: deploy
           It is IMPORTANT to note that this script cannot be run from any other
           directories.
           
       installjtests.sh [deploy_pack_dir]
           deploy_pack_dir - the directory where the current deployment is stored.
           The files from this directory are copied to the installation directory.
           
    To distribute the deployment in the cluster, use the <deploy_pack_dir>.tar.gz
    file that is created by the gendeploypack.sh script.
    
    Run the sudo setupcontroller.sh command on the controller node(s) you will use.
    This sets up the AppConfig for OpenSAF and resets the PSSV to use the XML source.
    
5.2  Running the CLM tests
  
    The CLM tests can be run manually.

    Before running the CLM tests, make sure that OpenSAF is running on the node
    where you plan to execute them. This can be either payload or controller.

    The main class for the CLM tests is the org.opensaf.ais.clm.test.AllTests class.
    This class and all the other test classes are packaged in the
    opensaf_ais_api_test.jar archive. To ease the execution, there is a utility script
    in the ais_api_test/configandscripts directory called runClmTests.sh. Use this to
    execute CLM tests.

    The main class uses the junit.textui.TestRunner to execute the tests and results
    are printed to the stdout.

    Now, Java CLM AIS API supports B.04.01 specifications, fill the required 
    version attribute values in properties file(java/ais_api_test/src/org/
    opensaf/ais/version.properties) to test the corrosponding version 
    implementation. By default test code tests B.04.01 functionality.
    
    Notice: in virtualized environments the timing diffences can cause some of the
    time constrained tests to fail. These are not a real failures and  they occur only
    accidentally.

    
5.3  Running the AMF tests
    The AMF tests cannot be run manually and AMF has to be configured properly
    for the tests.

    Provided AMF configuration (ais_api_test/configandscripts/AppConfig.xml.template)
      amfTestSG
        |
        |--SUs
        |    |--amfTestSU1 --> node PL_2_3
        |    |    `--amfTestComp
        |    `--amfTestSU2 --> node PL_2_3
        |         `--amfTestComp
        `--SIs
             |--amfTestSI_1
             |--amfTestSI_2
             `--amfTestSI_3
      amfAdditionalTestSG
        |--SUs
        |    |--amfAdditionalTestSU1 --> node PL_2_3
        |    |    `--amfAdditionalTestComp
        |    `--amfAdditionalTestSU2 --> node PL_2_4
        |         `--amfAdditionalTestComp
        `--SIs
             `--amfAdditionalTestSI

      amfTestComp = org.opensaf.ais.amf.test.AmfTestComponent
        This type of component only registers and reacts to callbacks.

      amfAdditionalTestComp = org.opensaf.ais.amf.test.AmfTestRunner
        This type of component registers with the AMF, and every time a CSI is
        assigned to it, it executes the test suite.

      This configuration may need to be adjusted to your current system. 
      
      The components will generate output to the <install_dir>/log directory.
            
5.4  Debug mode execution
        By default the native library is copiled with trace messages turned off.
        To turn them on, edit the trace.h file and remove the NDEBUG definition.
        After this compile the library again with the make command and rebuild the
        deployment configuration (Sec 5.1)

6. Using the Java projects with Eclipse
    Optionally start a new workspace.
    Create three new Java projects from Ant file. 
        Ant file: ais_api/build.xml
        Ant file: ais_api_impl/build.xml
        Ant file: ais_api_test/build.xml
        Check link to the build file in the system each time in the dialog box.
    Setup java 1.5 or 1.6 compliance in the project settings for all projects.
    Setup build path for ais_api_impl: ais_api
    Setup build path for ais_api_test: ais_api, ais_api_impl

7. Creating components
    User applications need the opensaf_ais_api.jar on the class path and the
    java_ais_api_native.so.xxx library on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Examples for 
    start scripts are the runClmTest.sh and the java_comp_inst.sh.
    
    To enable portability, use only functions provided by the Java AIS APIs.
