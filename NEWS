OpenSAF 5.2.0 (released 2017-04-10)
-----------------------------------

This is a major release containing new enhancements. Before installing or
upgrading to OpenSAF 5.2, make sure your system meets the minimum version
requirements of the following system components:

- Linux kernel, version 2.6.37 or later. Recommended version is Linux 3.18 or
  later when using the TCP transport, and Linux 4.4.22 or later when using the
  TIPC transport. Linux versions older than the recommended ones contain bugs
  that are known to affect the proper function of OpenSAF. Use of Linux versions
  older than the recommended ones together with OpenSAF is strongly discouraged.
- GNU C Library (Glibc), version 2.11 or later
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), version 4.8.1 or later
- Libxml2, version 2.7 or later
- Libopenssl, version 0.9.8 or later (optional)
- Libsqlite3, version 3.6 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-imm-pbe)
- OpenHPI, version 2.17.0 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)
- Libvirt, version 0.9.7 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)

When upgrading to OpenSAF 5.2.0 or later, be aware that SMF upgrade campaigns
can behave differently compared to earlier OpenSAF releases in case of component
failures. This is because Section 4.2.1.3 of SMF spec A.01.02 was implemented in
OpenSAF 5.2.0. You can disable this new feature in OpenSAF 5.17.08 by setting
the attribute osafAmfRestrictAutoRepairEnable to 0 in the AMF configuration
object amfConfig=1,safApp=safAmfService.

After upgrading to OpenSAF 5.2.0, please review the setting of
OSAF_CKPT_SHM_ALLOC_GUARANTEE in /etc/opensaf/ckptnd.conf. To avoid a
performance regression compared to OpenSAF 5.1.0, the default setting disables
the protection against situations when the POSIX shared memory is full. You must
change the setting of OSAF_CKPT_SHM_ALLOC_GUARANTEE if you wish to enable this
protection.
