Configuring OpenSAF
===================
NOTE: Upon installation of OpenSAF(through 'make install' or rpm install),
the $pkgsysconfdir/osafdir.conf (e.g. /etc/opensaf/osafdir.conf) shall contain
definitions of the directory paths where the OpenSAF packages are installed.

OpenSAF configuration files are located in the $pkgsysconfdir (e.g. /etc/opensaf)
directory. 


======================================================
OpenSAF can be built to be run as the root or to
run as the UNIX system user "opensaf" (default behaviour).
Upon doing a 'make install' when OpenSAF is built to 
run as the opensaf user, then the following steps have to be done:
Notes: 
- These steps are not necessary if doing an rpm installation. 
- If user wishes to run OpenSAF as the root user, then the below
steps can be ignored by building OpenSAF with the option 
$./configure CPPFLAGS=-DRUNASROOT

0) groupadd -r opensaf
1) useradd -r -g opensaf -d /usr/local/share/opensaf/ -s /sbin/nologin -c "OpenSAF" opensaf
2) echo "opensaf ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot, /sbin/tipc-config, /usr/bin/pkill, /usr/bin/killall" >> /etc/sudoers
3) echo 'Defaults:%opensaf !requiretty' >> /etc/sudoers
4) echo 'Defaults:opensaf !requiretty' >> /etc/sudoers
5) chown opensaf /var/lib/opensaf
6) chgrp opensaf /var/lib/opensaf
7) chown opensaf /var/run/opensaf
8) chgrp opensaf /var/run/opensaf
9) chown -R opensaf /var/log/opensaf
10) chgrp -R opensaf /var/log/opensaf
======================================================

Following is the brief description of each such configuration file.

*******************************************************************************
amfd.conf

This file contains configuration options for the AMF director. This file has to
be modified in the following cases:

OSAF_AMF_MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE should be set to the minimum number of nodes with
system controller capability that you wish to have in the system. AMF will
reject attempts to delete a node from the IMM configuration if the total number
of such nodes would fall below this configured limit.


*******************************************************************************
clmna.conf

This file contains configuration options for the CLM node agent. This file has
to be modified in the following cases:

CLMNA_ELECTION_DELAY_TIME should be set to the time in milliseconds without any
active or standby system controller node that OpenSAF will wait before starting
an election for a new active system controller. CLMNA will detect the presence
of active and standby system controllers in the cluster. If no active or standby
system controller has been seen during the configured time period, CLMNA will
initiate an election with the own node as a candidate for a new active system
controller. Note that lowering this value will increase the risk for
split-brain. Values lower than 5000 are not recommended for clusters with more
than two system controllers. For legacy installations with only two system
controller nodes, the default delay of 200 ms should be sufficient. For systems
with a very large number of configured system controller nodes and/or with
unreliable network connections, values larger than 5000 may be needed.

CLMNA_ADDR_FAMILY and CLMNA_ADDR_VALUE let you specify the values shown in the
saClmNodeCurrAddressFamily and saClmNodeCurrAddress runtime attributes of the
node's SaClmNode IMM object. If these options are not set, CLM will try to try
to figure out the node's address by itself. Since a node can have more than one
network address, the address chosen by CLM may not be the address your
application is interested in. By explicitly specifying the address using
CLMNA_ADDR_FAMILY and CLMNA_ADDR_VALUE, you will be guaranteed that the correct
address is presented.

*******************************************************************************
dtmd.conf
 
This file contains MDS/TCP configuration parameters.
This file has to be edited only when you chose TCP as the mode of transport.
 
The variable DTM_NODE_IP should be set to IP address of that local node

*******************************************************************************
nid.conf

This file contains global configuration for OpenSAF. This file
has to be modified in the following cases: 

(a) To configure/choose the OpenSAF transport as being TIPC or TCP:
As the default behaviour, OpenSAF shall use TCP as the transport.

When TIPC is selected as the MDS transport: change MDS_TRANSPORT to "TIPC".

Note: By building OpenSAF with the option $ ./configure --enable-tipc 
(see also the OpenSAF README for build options) there is 
flexibility to change(after stopping OpenSAF on all nodes)
the OpenSAF transport between TIPC and TCP without having to rebuild.


(b) Setting the network interface and tipc network id when TIPC is the transport:
When TIPC is selected as MDS transport, the TIPC network interface name TIPC_ETH_IF is 
by default set to eth0 and the TIPC network Id TIPC_NET_ID is by default set to 1234.
These default values can be changed 'uniformly on all nodes' to
for eg:- TIPC_ETH_IF=eth3 and TIPC_NET_ID=4321.

Notes:
  This TIPC_NET_ID and  TIPC_ETH_IF  has to be edited only when TIPC chosen as the mode of transport.
  The interface name (TIPC_ETH_IF) and network id (TIPC_NET_ID) arguments to the configure_tipc.in
  entry in nid.conf would get installed with default values. Please change this accordingly to 
  reflect your correct interface(s) and network-id information.

  Example 1, single interface:
  TIPC_ETH_IF=eth0
  TIPC_NET_ID=1234

  Example 2, dual interfaces:
  TIPC_ETH_IF=eth0,eth1
  TIPC_NET_ID=4321

  In the above line, eth0 and eth1 refers to the interface information and 1234 
  refers to a sample tipc network id. Please change them accordingly. This
  tipc-network id should be the same across all system controllers and payloads
  in that OpenSAF cluster. The Ethernet interfaces is a comma separated list as
  shown in the example 2 or just the name of a single interface as in
  example 1.

  Please note that OpenSAF recommend users to run TIPC on two separate bearers
  and let TIPC do the link aggregation. A bonded interface is not recommended.

  Also see http://tipc.sourceforge.net/doc/tipc_2.0_users_guide.html

  A bonded interface is not recommended. However OpenSAF does not currently 
  support managing two separate TIPC bearers. The missing support is logged in
  ticket http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1948
 

(d) OpenSAF should run as a different UNIX group and user than the default 'opensaf'
  group/user.

	If OpenSAF was built with the flags "CPPFLAGS=-DRUNASROOT", then
	change OPENSAF_GROUP and OPENSAF_USER to root i.e. for old (<4.2) behaviour.

	For any other user, change OPENSAF_GROUP and OPENSAF_USER accordingly
	after doing the following:

	If using RPMs, change the opensaf.spec.in file accordingly.
	More specifically the variables opensaf_user and opensaf_group at the 
	top of the RPM spec file.

	In the case of 'make install', do the steps listed in
	'Steps to configure opensaf user' above.

(e) If use of MDS subslot ID needs to be enabled, add TIPC_USE_SUBSLOT_ID=YES
    Note that the use of subslot ID is deprecated and should not be enabled
    in new installations.

(f) Time supervision of local node reboot should be disabled or changed.  Change
  OPENSAF_REBOOT_TIMEOUT to the desired number of seconds before a reboot is
  escalated to an immediate reboot via the SysRq interface, or zero to disable
  this feature.

(g) User's non-OpenSAF applications are also using TIPC and the user does not
  wants OpenSAF to manage(tipc configuration, insmod/rmmod) TIPC. In this case,
  change OPENSAF_MANAGE_TIPC="no". 
  Note: When user has taken the responsibility to manage TIPC, then before
  starting OpenSAF TIPC has to be configured according to OpenSAF requirements.
  This can be done by (re)using the /usr/lib(64)/opensaf/configure_tipc script
  as: $ configure_tipc start <interface name> <TIPC netid>
  For eg:- $ configure_tipc start eth0 9859

(h) Setting MDS_TIPC_MCAST_ENABLED to 1 or 0, allows OpenSAF to enable or
  disable TIPC Multicast Messaging and this configuration is valid when
  MDS_TRANSPORT is set to TIPC. By Default TIPC  Multicast Messaging is Enabled.

  Note: In case of TIPC Multicast Messaging disabled (0), the performance
  of OpenSAF will be considerably lower compared to Enabled (1).

(i) To use TIPC duplicate node address detection in cluster, while starting Opensaf
    we needs to enabled TIPC_DUPLICATE_NODE_DETECT=YES in
    `/usr/lib(64)/opensaf/configure_tipc`  script. 

    Note: In OS like Montavista where TIPC is built in kernel module,
    once TIPC has joined a network with a network-id & address
    it is not possible to change node address  until node reboots,
    so duplicate node verification is not possible and enable disable
    duplicate node verification (TIPC_DUPLICATE_NODE_DETECT=YES/NO)
    has NO effect.

*******************************************************************************
nodeinit.conf.<node_type>

This is the input file to the Node Initialization Daemon for serializing the
opensaf services startup.

<node_type> stands for 'controller' or 'payload'

By default `make install' will install pre-configured for a controller node, i.e.
the node_type file would contain the value 'controller'.
On a payload node, the node_type must be a changed to 'payload'
upon a 'make install'. For e.g.:

    % cd $pkgsysconfdir (e.g. /etc/opensaf/)
    % echo payload > node_type

*******************************************************************************
slot_id

The slot_id shall specify a unique value that represents a physical slot
identifier for the node in a chassis environment. It is typically set to the
same as the TIPC node ID.

By default, the slot_id contains a value of 1. While configuring
a new/second node in the cluster, this must be set to a unique/different 
value - for e.g. a value of 2 as below:
    % echo 2 > $pkgsysconfdir/slot_id

Starting with OpenSAF version 5.0, the maximum supported value for slot_id is
4095 when using the flat addressing scheme (i.e. when the use of subslot ID is
disabled). Prior to OpenSAF 5.0, the maximum supported value for slot_id was
255.

*******************************************************************************
subslot_id

The use of subslot ID is disabled by default. When disabled, subslot_id must be
set to 15 (which is the default value) on all nodes in the cluster.

*******************************************************************************
chassis_id

The chassis_id represents an identifier for the chassis (Distributed Computing
Environment) and should be set to an integer value. It is normally never changed
from what's installed.

*******************************************************************************
imm.xml

This is a generated file that contains the OpenSAF Information Model. It
contains the classes and configuration objects information of all OpenSAF
services.

By default based on the configuration options chosen, i.e. whether
a particular service is enabled or not, the imm.xml files of individual OpenSAF 
service are installed in $pkgimmxmldir 
(e.g. /usr/local/share/opensaf/immxml/services) directory.

Perform the following steps to generate the final/combined imm.xml. (Also
refer to the readme in $pkgimmxmldir (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/immxml/) directory.

% cd $(pkgimmxmldir) 

1) Generate a config file (nodes.cfg) for a 5 node cluster:

% sudo ./immxml-clustersize -s 2 -p 3

NOTE1: One can configure more than two system controller nodes as below:
% sudo ./immxml-clustersize -s 3 -p 2
In the above case, the configuration is generated for a 5 node cluster 
with 2 system controller nodes elected as ACTIVE and STANDBY while
the 3rd SC will run as spare SC and 2 nodes will run as payloads.

NOTE2: One can configure all nodes as system controller nodes (with no payloads)
as below:
% sudo ./immxml-clustersize -s 5

In the above case, the configuration is generated for a 5 node cluster 
with 2 system controller nodes elected as ACTIVE and STANDBY while
the remaining 3 nodes will run as spare system controller nodes.
(In this configuration, there are no payload nodes)


2) Edit nodes.cfg

The third column in nodes.cfg should be edited to match the short form of the
hostname (as shown by 'hostname -s') for each host.

3) Generate the imm.xml

% sudo ./immxml-configure

4) Copy the generated imm.xml file to the standard OpenSAF configuration directory.

For eg:
% sudo cp imm.xml.20100217_2201 /etc/opensaf/imm.xml

If the initial imm.xml is to be merged with some other file fragments the 
'immxml-merge' tool is used as shown below:

% cd /usr/share/opensaf/immxml
% sudo ./immxml-merge imm.xml.20100217_2201 my.xml > merged.xml
% sudo cp merged.xml /etc/opensaf/imm.xml

*******************************************************************************
node_name

This file is generated with the short form of the hostname ('hostname -s') when
the controller or payload rpm is installed.

The node_name file contains the RDN value of the CLM node name. A user can 
change the default value but the changed value 'must match' with the value 
specified in the nodes.cfg that was used to generate the imm.xml.i.e. the 
node_name value should match the value present in the generated imm.xml.

The node_name must be set to a unique value(as described above) for each node. 

*******************************************************************************
node_type

This file is generated when the controller or payload rpm is installed and
contains the associated node type name "controller" or "payload". If
'make install' is used, this file will always contain "controller".

This is a read-only configuration file that never should be edited.

*******************************************************************************
Per process config file

Every OpenSAF process has its own configuration file for the purpose of
controlling low level features such as tracing, location of configuration 
directories etc. Two files are worth mentioning since they probably needs
editing for at least a real deployment. For test and single node install
they work out of the box.

immnd.conf

This file is special since it contains many very important configuration
settings for the IMM service. See the immnd.conf file, the immsv README and the
IMM PR document for more information.

logd.conf

This file is worth mentioning since it contains the location of a
potentially shared between controllers directory where the LOG service stores
the generated log files.

*******************************************************************************
/etc/plmcd.conf

The plmcd.conf file has to be edited as below 'when PLM is enabled' while
building OpenSAF.

The following entries have to be modified accordingly:

[ee_id]
0020f

The ee_id field should contain the DN name of the EE hosting the OpenSAF controller
as specified by the SaPlmEE object.

For eg:-
IF the DN name of the EE object in the imm.xml is set to
...        <object class="SaPlmEE">
...                <dn>safEE=SC-1,safDomain=domain_1</dn>

THEN, the [ee_id] field should be set to 
[ee_id]
safEE=SC-1,safDomain=domain_1

Note: Here SC-1 is the default value specified in the nodes.cfg file while generating
the imm.xml

[controller_1_ip]
10.105.1.3

[controller_2_ip]
10.105.1.6

The controller_1_ip and controller_2_ip fields shall contain the IP Addresses
of the peer controllers.

[os_type]
This is a description of the OS. Currently it needs to follow 
# the following syntax, 1;os;Fedora;2.6.31, where 
# 1 => Version
# os => Product
# Fedora => Vendor
# 2.6.31 => Release
# Note that Version is mandatory while the other fields can be empty

The [os_type] field should match with the values contained
in the imm.xml for that EE.
It shall contain the attribute values of the SaPlmEEBaseType 
and SaPlmEEType objects, each separated by Semi-Colons.

For eg:-
IF The following is the version of the EE in the default imm.xml,
        <object class="SaPlmEEType">
                <dn>safVersion=1,safEEType=Linux_os</dn>

AND, the following is configured in the default imm.xml,

        <object class="SaPlmEEBaseType">
                <dn>safEEType=Linux_os</dn>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetProduct</name>
                        <value>os</value>
                </attr>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetVendor</name>
                        <value>SUSE</value>
                </attr>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetRelease</name>
                        <value>2.6</value>
                </attr>
        </object>

THEN, the [os_type] field shall be set to the following value:
[os_type]
1;os;SUSE;2.6

Setting resource limits for user applications running as 'non root' user
=========================================================================
One MDS thread exists(in the application context) when applications use
OpenSAF services' APIs. By default, this MDS thread is required to
run with a real time priority (see OSAF_MDS_SCHED_PRIORITY above).

From OpenSAF 4.2 onwards, applications that do not run with 'root' privileges
are expected to configure the resource limits for their application processes
such that the MDS thread is able to set realtime priority for itself.
i.e. Users have to setup RLIMIT_RTPRIO using setrlimit() or may configure
'rtprio' in the /etc/security/limits.conf for their applications.

Note: If resource limits are not configured as above then the MDS thread
(running in application context) will by default have/set a non-realtime 
priority with the scheduling policy of SCHED_OTHER.

SMF bundle check command
=========================================================================
SMF requires a command to be configured which is called to verify sw bundles invoked by the campaign. 
The command is configured in the OpenSafSmfConfig attribute smfBundleCheckCmd.
From OpenSAF 4.4 the smfBundleCheckCmd command as a part of the prerequisites tests.
Interface: The specified command is given the DN of the SaSmfSwBundle instance to check as argument.
	   configuredCmd <swBundleDN>
           e.g. myConfiguredCommand saSmfBundle=myBundle

	   The specified command must return 0 (zero) on success.

Note: The OpenSAF default implemetation is located at osaf/services/saf/smfsv/scripts/smf-bundle-check.
      Earlier default implementation of the command (which was never called from SMF) requires a bundle 
      name as input parameter. 
      From OpenSAF 4.4 the input parameter shall be the DN of the bundle to check.

Extended SaNameT type
=========================================================================
The SaNameT type is deprecated will be replaced with string parameters in new
SAF APIs. As an intermediate solution, the extended format of the SaNameT type
can be used to pass string parameters to and from old SAF APIs as well, by
tunneling them through the SaNameT type. To enable the extended SaNameT
format, the application source code has to be compiled with the
SA_EXTENDED_NAME_SOURCE preprocessor macro defined, and the environment
variable SA_ENABLE_EXTENDED_NAMES must be set to the value 1 before the first
call to any SAF API function.

When the extended SaNameT format is enabled, the SA_MAX_NAME_LENGTH constant
must not be used, and the application must treat the SaNameT type as opaque
and not access any of its members directly. Instead, the saAisNameLend() and
saAisNameBorrow() access functions shall be used. The
SA_MAX_UNEXTENDED_NAME_LENGTH constant can be used to refer to the maximum
string length that can be stored in the unextended SaNameT type.

Configuring remote fencing support using STONITH
================================================

In a virtual environment STONITH can be used to do remote fencing of the
other system controller in case of "link loss" or the peer system controller is
"live hanging", this to avoid split-brains.
Node self-fencing can also be used if e.g. the active controller loses
connectivity to all other nodes in the cluster.

Here follows an example of how to install and configure using Ubuntu 14.04,

On each virtual node install the stonith package:

  sudo apt-get install cluster-glue

The name of each virtual node should be the same as the CLM node name,
e.g. safNode=SC-2,safCluster=myClmCluster the virtual node name should be SC-2.

If TCP is used and if a firewall is used on the "hypervisor" host,
the TCP port 16509 has to be added to the firewall rule.
If SSH is used use ssh-keygen and generate ssh keys for each
virtual node.

To verify the installation virsh can be used, e.g:
virsh --connect=qemu+tcp://192.168.122.1/system list --all

Example of output:
Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 2     SC-1                           running
 3     SC-2                           running
 4     PL-3                           running

Update the fmd.conf file:

# The Promote active timer is set to delay the Standby controllers reboot request,
# as the Active controller probably also are requesting reboot of the standby.
# The resolution is in 10 ms units.
export FMS_PROMOTE_ACTIVE_TIMER=300

# Uncomment the next line to enable remote fencing
export FMS_USE_REMOTE_FENCING=1

Update the opensaf_reboot script:

# Uncomment these 4 lines and update accordingly
# See also documentation for STONITH
#export FMS_FENCE_CMD="stonith"
#export FMS_DEVICE_TYPE="external/libvirt"
#export FMS_HYPERVISOR_URI="qemu+tcp://192.168.122.1/system"
#export FMS_FENCE_ACTION="reset"

Environment variable OPENSAF_REBOOT_TIMEOUT can be set as a fallback if
the remote fencing fails and instead trigger a reboot of the local node.
