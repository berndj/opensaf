  DESCRIPTION:  Contains agent APIs to manage creation, configuration and
                destruction of MDS-DESTs.   The APIs are grouped into two
                classes for this purpose:
                1) ADA APIs : Absolute destination agent APIs
                2) VDA APIs : Virtual  destination agent APIs

   This is for obtaining an MDS virtual address against an arbitrary string.
   
   When any arbitrary string is provided, VDA will contact a VDS and try
   to obtain a MDS virtual destination(VDEST) address and an MDS virtual
   destination anchor.  On receiving such a VDEST address, it will create 
   that VDEST on the local MDS core, create a PWE 1 on it and return the 
   handle to that PWE.

   When the first time a string is used to get a virtual-address, a unique
   unused VDEST would be generated. It will be assigned a VDEST anchor
   value equal to 1. While this VDEST is in use, further VDEST_CREATE calls 
   with the same string would return the same VDEST but a different anchor
   value. The "persistent" option will determine whether and till when
   a VDEST remains associated to a string.

   If the "persistent" option is TRUE, then a string is permanently
   attached to a virtual-address. If a process that uses a 
   certain virtual address were to die, this association will 
   NOT be removed.  It will be maintained until an explicit
   VDEST_DESTROY call is made (once for every corresponding VDEST_CREATE 
   call)
   
   If "persistent" option is FALSE, then a virtual address will cease
   to be associated with a string as soon as all processes using this
   virtual address either expire or invoke the VDEST_DESTROY API.

   The "i_policy" determines the load-share policy among various 
   instances of a VDEST. Each VDEST instance is associated with
   an anchor value, making <VDEST, anchor> a unique address in the
   system. The load-sharing will be done among those VDEST instances
   which are running in an ACTIVE role. The load-share will only load-share
   requests originated locally; MDS will not attempt an exact load-share 
   on a global basis.

   The 'i_create_oac' determines whether an OAC needs to be created on
   the MDS_DEST being created. An OAC (MIB Object-Access-Client) service is 
   optional on an MDS-DEST. If the caller has a MIB tied to this VDEST (i.e. 
   it has the same life and role as this MDS-DESt) then it should set this 
   to TRUE. The `i_pwe1_oac_hdl` carries a handle to an OAC sitting on
   a PWE1 on the MDS-DEST created by this call.
   
   NOTE: 
   1) The "persistent" option should uniformly be either a TRUE or 
      a FALSE across multiple VDEST_CREATE calls for the same string-name.
   
   2) The VDEST_CREATE is a blocking call. The VDA uses the invoker's task 
      context to contact the VDS and returns only upon getting a response from 
      VDS.
