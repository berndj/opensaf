# NOTE 1: This script is a customization point between OpenSAF and a target
# system and should be changed according to the needs of such system.

# NOTE 2: The script must be idempotent, i.e. it must be harmless to call it
# more than one time with the same parameters. The second call should do nothing
# since the nodes were added to the cluster the first time the script was
# called.

# NOTE 3: This example script requires write access to the $pkgimmxmldir
# directory

# Remove the following line when customizing this script.
