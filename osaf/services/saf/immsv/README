GENERAL
=======
This directory (osaf/services/saf/immsv) contains an implementation of the
SAF IMM service version A.02.01.

Application programmers intending to interface with immsv should primarily read
the document "OpenSAF IMM Service Release 4 Programmer's Reference" and of
course the IMM standard (SAI-AIS-IMM-A.02.01).

This document provides an overview of the design and internals of the immsv. 
It is intended for maintainers or trouble-shooters of the immsv in OpenSAF.
Familiarity with the IMM standard is obviously also needed for understanding
this document. 

The IMM service follows the three tier OpenSAF "Service Director" framework
(see OpenSAF Overview User's Guide).
As such, the process structure consists of:

        * The IMM Director process type (IMMD).
        * The IMM Node Director process type (IMMND).
        * The application procesesses linked with the IMM Agent library (IMMA).

IMMD
====
The IMMD is implemented as a server process executing on the controllers using
a 2N redundancy model. The IMMD on the active controller can be seen as the 
"central master" of the IMM service. The standby IMMD is kept up-to-date by the
active IMMD using the message based checkpointing service. If the active 
controller goes down, the standby controller becomes active by order from the
AMF. A crash of any director process, such as the IMMD, will escalate to a
restart of the active controller, which of course implies a fail-over of the
directors for all services.

The active IMMD tracks the cluster membership (using MDS/tipc) and controls 
which nodes/IMMNDs currently can provide access to the IMM service. 
Note: the current implementation of IMM does not use the SAF CLM service. 
That service is only at the node level. The cluster that is tracked by the IMMD
will loose and gain membership not only when nodes leave and join, but also when
IMMND processes crash and restart. The crash of an IMMND process does *not*
imply the restart of the node where it executes. 

The set of IMMNDs known by the IMMD is the basis for the two main functions of
the IMMD:

        * FEVS, a reliable multicast between IMMNDs.
        * Election of IMMND coordinator.

To understand the current implementation of the IMM service, it helps to know
that it was first developed in a different context. That context used Extended
Virtual Synchrony (EVS) as the basic cluster communication protocol.
It had only one server process type implementing the IMM service and it executed
symmetrically, one server process on each node. That implementation has now been 
ported to the OpenSAF middle-ware. The single symmetrically distributed process
now corresponds to the IMMND process type. The IMMD provides a replacement for
EVS that we call FEVS. 

FEVS (Fake EVS) is so named because it roughly emulates the semantics (but not
the API) of EVS. That is, FEVS tries to provide a reliable multicast over a set 
of members plus control over changes of membership. By "reliable" we mean that
any FEVS message arriving at a member, must arrive at all current members and 
in the same order. Thus it provides non-loss and uniform ordering of messages.
In addition, when a member joins or leaves, the other members see that join or
leave at the same point in the FEVS message sequence. 

The other function of the IMMD, election of IMMND coordinator, concerns a minor
asymmetry between the IMMNDs. One of the current IMMND members has to take on 
the role of IMMND coordinator. Exactly what this means is explained in the next
section. Here it suffices to say that it does not matter which one of the 
current IMMND members takes on this role, only that one and only one of the
IMMNDs has this role at all times. The IMMD will always decide which IMMND is
the current coordinator. 

The IMMD is quite lean, simple and small in its functionality. It is almost not 
imm service specific at all. This increases the probability that it is robust
and stays so. This is good given the serious escalation caused by the failure
of any director process, in OpenSAF.


IMMND
=====
The IMMND is implemented as a server process executing on all nodes (both 
controllers and payloads) according to the "No Redundancy" model. Each IMMND
handles all connections made by clients to the IMM service, at that node.
This off-loads the central IMMD server from handling any client related data.
In fact, an IMMD fail-over will not impact any clients, except the clients at
the active controller itself which has to restart. 

The IMMND process is the "real" IMM server. It contains the IMM data model,
which holds the configuration and runtime objects that is the core of the 
IMM service. It also has information about all implementers, admin-owners and 
CCBs currently registered. In the current implementation, this repository is 
symmetrically replicated over the IMMND at all processors. This will optimise 
for read access, since all such accesses can be kept purely node-local.

Updates on the other hand, must be replicated to all IMMNDs. To ensure that all
IMMNDs are kept consistent and complete, the IMM service uses the FEVS protocol
provided by the IMMD. When a client issues a request that implies a mutation of
the IMM repository, the local IMMND that receives the request does not
immediately apply the request. Instead it FEVS forwards the request to the IMMD.
The IMMD in turn will add a sequence number to the message and then forward the
message to all IMMNDs (including the originating IMMND), using MDS broadcast.

Since all such messages pass through the single active IMMD process, a total
order is enforced. The sequence number added by the IMMD is only used as a
redundant check for completeness (non-loss). Any IMMND that receives an
out-of-sequence message will not apply that message. Instead it will either
restart and request a "sync"; or it may request a resend from the IMMD of the
missing message(s). [The resend variant is not yet fully implemented.]

The IMMND processes are in essence symmetrically equivalent. But there are a few
important exceptions. First, the details of connections are maintained only at
the local IMMND. Other IMMNDs will, for example, know which node an attached 
implementer resides on, but not the exact connection for a remote implementer.
Any need to reach a remote implementer is solved by communicating with the 
IMMND at that node. Second, at all times when the IMM service is operational,
one and only one of the IMMNDs is designated the IMMND-coordinator. The IMMND 
that is currently the coordinator will take on the task of conducting a few
cluster global operations when needed:

        * Initial loading; 
        * Sync of restarted IMMNDs; 
        * Aborting CCBs waiting on apparently hung implementors. 

A very good question here is: why not move the IMMND coordinator role to the 
active IMMD? This is indeed possible to do, but there are at least a few 
arguments against it. 

First, these three tasks depend on knowledge of the current state of CCBs.
At the start of a sync, there is a period of grace where the IMMSv will not
accept new CCBs, but will allow already started CCBs to complete. A CCB can not
be aborted if it is in the critical phase of distributed commit. Loading also 
has to be coordinated with sync, because the loading is often followed
immediately by a sync of any straggler nodes that missed the start of the
loading sequence. The dependency on CCB state could be solved by involving the
IMMD in the CCB life cycle. But since all IMMNDs are already involved in the CCB
handling and sync, there is no real simplification in also involving the IMMD.
The only way to really simplify would be to move the entire repository to the
IMMD, converting to the "Service Server" framework, or possibly keeping the
IMMNDs but only for client connection management. Indeed, we may end up there in
the future.

Second, there is a strong argument for keeping the IMMDs simple and by
implication robust. A crash of an IMMD causes a controller fail-over, but a
crash of an IMMND, even on the active controller, only causes a restart of the
IMMND. 

Finally, another reason why the IMMND coordinator role does not reside with the 
active IMMD is historical, that it was ported from an EVS based implementation.

The coordinator IMMND can theoretically be any IMMND in the system. In the
current implementation we have restricted it to reside on a controller node.
The only reason for this restriction is that the task of loading requires
access to the file system and we do not wish to assume that payloads have such
access. In the future we may enhance the reliability of the IMM service by
allowing any IMMND to become coordinator once the IMMNDs have loaded. 

The current limitation, that the IMMND coordinator must reside on a controller,
has a downside.  If the IMMNDs at both controllers fail, the IMMD can not elect
any coordinator. Instead the IMMD has to order all IMMNDs to restart, which 
currently causes a cluster restart.


IMMA
====

The client interface conforms to the OpenSAF agent library framework. The IMMA
library (libSaImmOm.so and libSaImmOi.so) only communicate with the node local
IMMND process. As explained previously, all read accesses made by the client
are kept node-local. In addition, the values for basic immsv handles:

        SaImmHandleT
        SaImmSearchHanldeT
        SaImmAccessorHandleT
        SaImmOiHandleT

are all set by the local IMMND without going remote to the IMMD or other IMMNDs. 
The following handles are related to resource allocation, need global validity
and therefore are initialised over FEVS.

        SaImmAdminOwnerHandleT (linked to SaImmHandleT)
        SaImmCcbHandleT        (linked to SaImmAdminOwnerHandleT & SaImmHandleT)
        SaImmOiImplemenerNameT (linked to SaImmOiHandleT).

Because the basic handles are allocated and known only by the local IMMND, a
crash or termination of that IMMND will cause the IMMA library instantiations
at the node to mark all its handles as stale. Even global handles allocated via
the crashed IMMND are effectively stale because they depend on the local handles. 

The restart of an IMMND should still normally be transparent to the clients 
at that node. The IMMA library tries to resurrect the handles once the IMMND
at the node has restarted. In some cases the IMMA will not be able to 
resurrect the handle. One example is if the handle is related to an admin-owner
handle with the 'release-on-finalize' option set ot true. 
Some clients may then get their handles invalidated. Any attempt by a client
to use such a stale and unsuccessfully resurected handle will result in a
reply of SA_AIS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE. 

Note that it is at least not necessary for the client applications to restart.
They may reconnect by simply allocating a new handle. Of course, CCBs that
originated at the node and that where not applied, are aborted. Implementers
need to re-attach. Admin-ownership needs to be reclaimed etc, if you have
allocated a new handle to replace a stale one.

From the perspective of the other nodes, the termination of a remote IMMND is
handled in the same way as if the node it executed on terminated, i.e. the
resources allocated by any client at that node are released. Note however that
such a release of resources by the other IMMNDs is not done immediately or
autonomously by each node. Instead a release order is sent over FEVS. 
The actual release is done when the FEVS message arrives at the IMMNDs,
ensuring that all IMMNDs release the resource at the same point in the FEVS
message sequence.


PERSISTENCE
===========
The IMM standard mandates that configuration attributes and persistent runtime
attributes shall be persistent in the sense that such values must survive a
cluster restart and that this must hold for every applied CCB. 

The default option for the current implementation of the IMMSv in OpenSAF is
that it does not fully support persistence at the CCB granularity. Instead
it supports persistence at the coarse granularity of dump/backup. Thus the
user must ensure that the IMM is dumped after important changes are made to
such data. The configuration data and persistent runtime data will survive
cluster restart, but only the latest dumped version will be recovered.

One of the main new immsv features available in OpenSAF4.0 is the 
Persistent Back-End (PBE). By default this feature is not enabled.
See the instructions below for how to enable it. The reason it
is not enabled by default is that the feature is not yet extensively
tested. In addition, use of the PBE has a signifigant impact on
performance for CCBs and persitent runtime data, both response time
and throughput. By making the feature available in OpenSAF4.0 we
hope that some users will try to use it, or at least test it and
give us feedback on problems. This also means that the PBE is 
a "supported feature" of OpenSAF4.0. It is then possible to write
tickets on this functionality. If the ticket is valid and of
sufficient priority (according to OpenSAF), then will get fixed. 


-----------------------------------------------

The IMM-PBE feature is an optional feature.
To enable this feature the folowing three steps are needed. 

	1) ++++++BUILD WITH PBE+++++++

	In the configure step for OpenSAF enable the pbe:

	./configure --enable-imm-pbe

	You would typically also give other options to configure at the same time.

	Ensure that OpenSAF builds without problems. In particular that it finds
	the sqlite3 include files and the sqlite3 library, which is used by PBE.

	2) ++++++CONFIGURE PBE DEPLOYMENT+++++++++

	Edit 'osaf/services/saf/immsv/config/immnd.conf' or in the 
	deployed system typically '/etc/opensaf/immnd.conf'.

	Ensure the IMMSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY points to a shared file system,
	the sqlite3 database file has to be accessible from both controllers!
	In deployment the IMMSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY would typically be set to
	'/var/lib/opensaf/immsv_store'. In the UML simulated deployment,
	this is normally linked symbolically to 'hostfs/repl-opensaf/immsv_store'.

	Define IMMSV_PBE_FILE to the file name of the sqlite3 database file,
	normally 'imm.db'. 
	Note that IMMSV_LOAD_FILE must still also be defined. Even with PBE
	enabled, you typically initial start from an imm.xml file.

	Optionally define IMMSV_PBE_TMP_DIR (see immnd.conf). The PBE sometimes
        needs to regenerate the imm.db file. This is much faster (10 times) if
        the file is generated in a non replicated file system and then copied
        to the replicated file system.

	Initial start the system.
	Ensure that it comes up (that the immsv loads properly from imm.xml).

	3) +++++ENABLE PBE++++++++

	On one of the nodes execute:

	immcfg -m -a saImmRepositoryInit=1 \
	   safRdn=immManagement,safApp=safImmService

	This sets the saImmRepositoryInit attribute in the IMM service
	object to SA_IMM_KEP_RESPOSITORY (1).

	If this immcfg command succeeds, the pbe is runtime enabled and the 
	pbe-daemon process should have started and it should have generated
	the first dump to the pbe-file.
	A 'ps' on the controller where the IMMND coord currently resides 
	should show something like:

        618 root 22320 S N  /usr/local/bin/immdump --daemon --pbe /var/lib/..

	The PBE feature can at any time be disabled by:

	immcfg -m -a saImmRepositoryInit=2 \
	   safRdn=immManagement,safApp=safImmService

---------------------

SCHEMA CHANGES
==============
OpenSAF 4.1 adds the immsv enhancement of supporting schema changes, that is
changes at runtime to existing class definitions. For more background see
ticket #1310: http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1310

The new class definition must of course be valid in itself, i.e. it must
pass all tests that a first version of a class has to pass. 
On top of this there are many restrictions that apply to a schema change.

The kinds of change allowed in OpenSAF 4.1 are limited to addition of
new attributes and changes to existing attributes. Removal of existing
attributes are not allowed. Furthermore, not all kinds of additions or
changes are allowed. In general, relaxation changes are allowed while
restricting changes are not. 

The following changes are allowed:

ADDITION of new attributes when the 'initialized' flag is not set.

CHANGE of an existing attribute if it is one of the following:

   * Change of default-value for an attribute (config or runtime).
     New instances of the class will get the new default,
     old instances retain the old value.

   * Adding 'multivalued' flag for an attribute (config or runtime).

   * Adding 'writable' flag for an attribute (config).

   * Removing 'initialized' flag for an attribute (config).

   * Removing 'persistent' flag for an attribute (runtime).


All other changes, such as change of attribute type, removal of default,
addition of default, etc are not allowed.

There is no API change. The existing saImmOmClassCreate_2 call is used
to insert the new class version. The standard behavior is to reject 
a class create call with ERR_EXIST if the class name matches an existing class.
This is also still the defalt behavior. But if schema change is enabled,
(explained below), then a new definition for an existing class is 
interpreted as an attempt to change that existing definintion. 
The implied change is analyzed to ensure that it is an allowed change
according to the above rules. If it is allowed, the new class definition
replaces the old and all existing instances are migrated to the new 
representation. If PBE is enabled, the entire change is made persistent.

To enable the non standard schema change support, the following admin 
operation must be executed: 

        immadm -o 1 -p opensafImmNostdFlags:SA_UINT32_T:1 \
           opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService

The will set the lowest order bit of the 'opensafImmNostdFlags' runtime
attribute inside the immsv. Operation-id '1' invoked on the object
'opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService' has the meaning of 'flags-ON'.
The lowest order flag is the allow-schema-change flag which controls the
schema-change behavior. With this flag switched on, the immsv accepts
legal schema changes. If this flag is off, the immsv follows the standard 
behavior of rejecting all implied schema changes with ERR_EXIST.

The flag is switched off by a corresponding admin operation. Operation-id '2'
invoked on the object 'opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService' has the
meaning of 'flags-OFF'. 

        immadm -o 2 -p opensafImmNostdFlags:SA_UINT32_T:1 \
           opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService

We strongly recommend that the flag is switched off as soon as any intended
schema change has been completed. This to avoid legal but unintended (!) 
schema changes. For example, two applications may accidentally use the 
same class name. If the first application is already installed when the
second application arrives and the second application redefines the class
in such a way that it is valid when interpreted as an implied upgrade,
then the class could be upgraded. This could have many unintended
consequences which also could be very hard to troubleshoot. The example
also illustrates the importance of propper prefixing of classnames,
since the class name-space is flat (as opposed to the naming tree
for objects). 

If PBE is enabled, the current value of opensafImmNostdFlags can be inspected
via the cached non-persistent runtime attribute 'opensafImmNostdFlags' in the
object  'opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService'. 
If PBE is not enabled, then this runtime attribute is not accessible, because
there is no regular implementer attached. But the above admin operations are
still handled by the immsv and the schema change behavior is still controlled
the same way.

MULTIPLE APPLIERS (4.2)
======================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1827
OpenSAF 4.2 adds the immsv enhancement of supporting multiple appliers for
configuration objects. An applier is an OI (object implementer) of lower
rank than the primary OI. The primary OI validates the CCB and has veto
rights to abort any CCB it participates in. If the CCB commits then the
pimary OI will apply the changes into the service/application it represents.
If the CCB aborts then the primary OI discards the changes. 

The most signifficant deficiency of having only a primary OI per class/object
is that it is not simple to implement hot-standby solutions.
A hot-standby solution requires the primary OI to inform the standby, by
implementing some form of message protocol at the service/application level.
The concept of an "applier OI" removes this deficiency and allows the
service/application to use the imm to disseminate the changes. 

An applier OI registers the same way as the main OI and receives exactly
the same CCB related upcalls as the primary OI. The difference is that an
applier OI does not participate in CCB validation. The imm-service ignores
any reply on the create,delete,modify and completed upcalls, from applier OIs.
An applier OI does not get uppcalls for admin-operations or for updating
runtime attributes. This should be obvious since admin-ops or updates
to runtime attributes should only be handled by the main-oi. 

The applier OI is thus informed of the same changes as the primary OI
and will be able to apply the changes if the CCB commits and discard them
if the CCB aborts. Exaclty what "apply" here means is up to the application.
The main point here is that it means that the applier has the tools to be
a hot standby, or to perform whatever needs to be done in order to effect
the configuration change that was applied. 

There may be any number of appliers for any given class/object. Thus the
applier OI concept may be used not just to solve the "hot standby" problem
but also for the more general problem of effecting the apply of a CCB over
the applications components in the cluster. In the AMF example above, the
osafamfnd processes (node director processes) could in principle also 
attach as applier OIs and register any configuration changes that apply
to the specific node. 

Another way of stating this is that the applier-OI concept allows IMM 
users to leverage the the IMM CCB protocol for more than the primary 
purpose of that protocol. 

The A.02 API is used but the applier concept is only available to an OI
that registers with version A.02.11 (or higher minor version). 
An OI-name is recognized as the name for an applier OI by the imm-service
if the first character in the name is '@'. For example, the AMF OI is 
named 'safAmfService' and implemented by the osafamfd process at the
active SC. The osafamfd at the standby SC could become more of a hot
standby by registering as the applier OI '@safAmfService'.

As always, only one process/OI-handle may at any point in time be 
associated with a particular OI-name. This holds also for applier-OI
names. And as always, an OI-handle may be associated with at most one
implementer/applier-name at a time. So in case of a switch-over (si-swap),
the osafamfd processes would close their current OI-handles (or invoke 
saImmOiImplementerClear). Then the osafamfd processes would attach to
either the main OI (safAmfService) or the applier OI (@safAmfService),
using saImmOiImplementerSet. 

A word of caution about implementer names. Implementer names are to
be re-used. They are never garbage collected by the imm service.
An implementer-name may have no current live implementer handle attached,
but once created, it lives "forever" ready for the next attach,
(SaImmOiImplementerSet). Implementer-names could be compared to Unix port
numbers. A port number on some particular host is (in general)
statically mapped to a service on that host. The service may not always
be up and running, but there should never be any *other* service bound
to the port number. Similarly, an implementer-name is in a given cluster
generally mapped to a service. A service should avoid spawning "dynamic"
implementer names, and avoid incorporating volatile name spaces such as
process-id or time in the name. This may have been obvious for regular
OIs. But with the addition of multiple appliers, there is a risk is that
this is interpreted as an open-ended set of appliers, consuming an open
ended ammount of resources. This would be incorrect design.
An application/service must design for a static set of OIs implying a
static set of OI names, including a static set of applier OIs and
a static set of applier names.

Another difference between regular regular implementers and appliers,
is that regular implementer names and their binding to a set of objects
will survive a cluster restart, whereas applier names and their binding
to objects does not survive a cluster restart. That is, a regular
implementer name is persistent in the face of a cluster restart, as
long as it has been bound to at least one object. But an applier name
is not persistent in the face of a cluster restart, regardless of
whether it has been bound to anything. The main reason for this is
that the regular implementer name is stored with each object in the
special single valued service attribute: saImmAttrImplementerName. 

Note here that the binding of a regular implementer-name to a class
(as a result of saImmOiClassImplementerSet) does not survive a 
cluster restart. So an application that intends to attach as a class
implementer should always exlplicitly set the class implementer. 
If the class implementer is already set, this operation returns 
SA_AIS_OK anyway. The "feature" of attachign to an already set
up implementer structure is of dubious value, since the application
must then be aware of its starting context. 

Applier bindings are even weaker in this "staring context" sense
because applier bindings to object/class are not synced. The only
applier data that is synced (after a node restart) is the existence of
the applier name and whether ot not any client is currently attached as
that applier. 

The most efficient and simplest and normal way to bind an implementer
or applier to objects is by using the saImmOiClassImplementerSet call.
This ensures that the implementer-name is always bound to all instnces
of that class. It ensures that the OI will get the saImmOiObjectCreate
upcall, which is only possible for class-implementers, since you can
not register with saImmOiObjectImplementerSet on an object that does
not yet exist. 

The use of saImmOiObjectImplementerSet is mainly for cases when there 
are very few instances of a class and each instance is to be linked 
to a an implementer that behaves in a way specific to that instance. 

For appliers, attaching as an object-applier could be usefull as a
way of "eavesdropping" on the changes affecting a particular object,
or a few select objects. But invoking saImmObjectImplementerSet
with an applier name, for a large subtree of objects will be much
more expensive in memory than just registering for the class(es)
of these objects. 


SUPPORT FOR CCB-OI ERROR STRINGS (4.2) 
=====================================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1904
OpenSAF 4.2 adds the immsv enhancement of supporting ccb error strings
from OI to OM client. Two new API calls are available for this for
clients that register with imm version A.2.11:

(1)
extern SaAisErrorT
saImmOiCcbSetErrorString(SaImmOiHandleT immOiHandle,  /* in */
                         SaImmOiCcbIdT ccbId,         /* in */
                         const SaStringT errorString);/* in */

Allows an OI to set an error string in the context of a ccb related
upcall. Setting an error string is only relevant if the OI will
return with error (not SA_AIS_OK) on the upcall.  The error
string will be transmitted to the OM client. Only one error string
will be accepted per OI upcall. Setting additional error strings
in the same OI upcall will simply replace the previous one. 
Multiple error strings may however be set from different OIs
in different upcalls related to the same OM downcall (e.g.
saImmOmCcbApply). Setting an error string is only possible
inside oi-upcalls that have a return code. Thus it is NOT
possible inside SaImmOiCcbApplyCallbackT or SaImmOiCcbAbortCallbackT.

(2)
extern SaAisErrorT
saImmOmCcbGetErrorStrings(
        SaImmCcbHandleT ccbHandle,      /* in */
        const SaStringT **errorStrings);/* out */

Allows the OM client to fetch error strings after the return of a
ccb-related downcall and *before* making the next ccb-related
downcall using the same ccb-handle. If any error string where 
set by any OIs involved in the operation that returned with
error, then these error strings should be included in the list.
The imm server discards duplicate strings and allows a maximum
of 128 error strings in the list. Any ccb call that returns
SA_AIS_OK will not have any error-strings.

NOTE: It is very important that the OM client completes its
processing of the errorStrings before invoking the next
ccb downcall using the same ccbHandle. The next such downcall
will free the error strings. If the om user needs the error 
strings after re-using the ccbHandle, the user must copy the 
strings before such re-use. Note also that the 'errorStrings'
out parameter is declared as 'const', indicating that deallocation
of 'errorStrings' is here done by the library (not the user).


IMPROVED ADMIN-OPERATION API (4.2)
====================================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1764
Allows the OI to supply a return paramater list in the same way 
as the OM client has always been able to supply a parameter list
as part of an admin-operation-invocation. The reply from the OI
is in other respects identical to A.2.1.
Api additions for this are available to imm clients that register
with imm version A.2.11:

(1)

Allows the OI to reply on the admin-operation with the added list
of return parameters. Works otherwise in the same way as the 
original saImmOiAdminOperationResult. If returnParams is set to 
NULL then the reply is identical to using the original reply form.

               SaImmOmAdminOperationInvokeCallbackT_o2
               saImmOmAdminOperationInvokeCallback;
} SaImmCallbacksT_o2;

Defines a new OM callback that allows asyncronous admin-ops to 
receive the added return parameter list. Note that 'returnParams'
is here a 'const' parameter, indicating that deallocation of the
parameter list is here done by the library (not the user).
The deallocation is done after the user returns from the upcall.

        SaVersionT *version);                  /* inout */

A new OM-handle-initialize call is needed for supporting the new
OM callback.

        SaImmAdminOperationParamsT_2 ***returnParams);/* out */

The syncronous admin-operation downcall. The only difference in
respect to the original saImmOmAdminOperationInvoke is the new
added out parameter 'returnParams'. Note that 'returnParams' is
NOT declared const, indicating that it is the users responsibility
to de-allocate the parameter list. See next point.


(6)
extern SaAisErrorT
saImmOmAdminOperationMemoryFree(
        SaImmAdminOwnerHandleT ownerHandle,          /* in */
        SaImmAdminOperationParamsT_2 **returnParams);/* in */

Allows the OM client to free the memory for a parameter list.
The parameter list would have been received by a syncronous
admin-operation downcall, i.e. via 'returnParams' in a call of
'saImmOmAdminOperationInvoke_o2'.

(7)
#define SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_ERROR      "SaImmAdminOperationError"

If an OI intends to reply with an error code (no SA_AIS_OK) as the
result of an admin-operation, then the OI may include an error
string in the list of return parameters. Typically this will be the
only paramteter included when there is an error, but the API allows
any number of paramters to be returned regardless of the return code.
The error string is identified by a parameter with the parameter-name
of SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_ERROR.
This is a convention, but it gives the OM client a chance to probe
for such an error string when it receives a non OK result. 

(8)
#define SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_ID_ESC     0x8000000000000000LL  
#define SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_NAME       "SaImmAdminOperationName"

If an OM client sets the 'operationId' to the value of 
SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_ID_ESC, then it indicates the intention to 
identify the admin-operation using a string name instead of the
numerical operationId. The OM client must then include a parameter
with the name SA_IMM_PARAM_ADMOP_NAME in the paramter list.
The type of this parameter must be SaStringT and the value is the
name of the operation.
This is a convention, but it allows decoupling between the OI
client and OM client in the use of admin-operation names. 
In future releases, this convention may also be the basis for
supporting the inclusion of amdmin-operation definitions associated
with an imm-class; and for supporting more elaborate runtime type
checking of admin-operation invocations and replies, by the imm
service. 


OI AUGMENTED CCBs (4.2)
====================================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1963

OpenSAF 4.2 adds the immsv enhancement of supporting OI augmented
CCBs. This feature is available for OI clients that register with
imm version A.2.11. 

The basic idea is to allow a configuration object implementer to
add CCB operations to an existing CCB, in the context of create-,
delete-, or modify-upcalls on a configuration object. The OI
then extends the set of changes, originating from an OM client,
that will commit or abort atomically with the original CCB.
This could be seen as a variant of 'database triggers'. In
other words, logic that is triggered by changes initiated
by a client and which extends the set of modifications done by
the transaction. 

Warnings.
--------
A note of warning: This feature must be used with prudence
and care by OI designers. The feature allows the OI to add side
effects to a CCB, which the originator of the CCB typically is
unaware of. It may also impact the performance characteristics
of the ccb use-case, or prevent the ccb from being committed, 
e.g. by causing timeout during processing. OI augmentations to
the same objects operated on by the original OM client could
subvert or interfere with the intended effect. 

The OI designer also needs to take care in avoiding deadlocks
with other OIs. More on this below.

The ideal pattern of use for this feature is when the OI adds
a small ammount of operations that are directed at 'implementation
config objects' private to the OI. The risk for interference with
the intention of the original CCB is then minimal. We are not talking
about runtime data here. It has always been possible for an OI to
add/remove/update runtime objects/attributes as a side effect of the
apply of a configuration change. Runtime data is updated via the OI
API, may be triggered by CCBs, but are not part of CCBs, i.e. not
atomic with them. Runtime data is used by the OI to communicate
information *to* OM clients. Here we are instead talking about
'private configuration data', or configuration data for a sub service,
or related service, that needs to be modified as a side effect of
the original modification.

Api
---

The API available to the OI for this feature under IMM interface
version A.2.11 is:

	extern SaAisErrorT
	saImmOiAugmentCcbInitialize(
			     SaImmOiHandleT immOiHandle,
			     SaImmOiCcbIdT ccbId,
			     SaImmCcbHandleT *ccbHandle,
			     SaImmAdminOwnerHandleT *ownerHandle);

The OI inputs its oi-handle and the ccbId it received in the upcall.
In return it gets an OM CCB handle and an AdminOwner handle.
The Imm service has marked these handles as special. They are
only valid for the duration of the upcall.

An OI is only allowed to invoke the saImmOiAugmentCcbInitialize call
inside these upcalls:

    SaImmOiCcbObjectCreateCallbackT_2
    SaImmOiCcbObjectDeleteCallbackT
    SaImmOiccbobjectModifyCallbackT_2

It would have been nice to support augmentation also inside the
SaImmOiCcbCompletedCallbackT upcall, but since validation is the
purpose of that upcall and there may be many OIs involved in the
completion of a CCB, changing the base of validation during
the validation would make validation practically impossible.

The OI augmentation CCB must be 'applied' by the OI before it
returns from the upcall in which the augmentation is done.
Such an 'apply' of an augmentation is not the actual final apply,
since that is dependent on the apply of the originating root CCB.
The 'apply' of an augmentation is only the confirmation from the
OI that the augmentation was completed by the OI.

The typical OI is already using the OM interface to read its initial
state, so all the normal ccb related calls should already be accessible,
using the provided ccbHandle. (The OI needs to include saImmOm.h
lexically before the include of saImmOi.h).

If the saImmOiAugmentCcbInitialize call succeeds, the OI can
use the CCB handle to request create, delete, or modify operations,
followed by an apply, or possibly a finalize without apply resulting
in abort. 

An abort of the augment CCB by the OI will abort the entire 
originating CCB, unless the augmentation was empty at the time of
abort/finalize. The augmentation is empty untill at least one
augmented create, delete or modify operation has succeeded and 
no augment operation has failed with SA_AIS_ERR_FAILED_OPERATION.
The FAILED_OPERATION return code, as usual, means abort of *entire* 
CCB, not just the operation that resulted in this return code.
And *entire* CCB here means the OM originated root CCB, not just the
augmented CCB done by the OI. Thus augmented CCBs are not 'nested
transactions' in that they can not be aborted independently of the
root CCB. 

If the OI adds operations to the CCB for objects which it is itself
the implementer for, then it will not receive any OI-upcall for
such operations. This is mainly to avoid the OI getting into
deadlock with itself. But it should also not be necessary for
the OI to get such upcalls, since it already has the information
about the changes it itself added. The OI may even create a modify
on the object that is the basis of the upcall it is executing in.
(This should be an unusual case and done with care, as it is in
some sense overriding the 'intention' of the original client). 

It will still be posible for two or more OIs to get into a
distributed deadlock with each other by their use of CCB
augmentation. If such an upcall cycle is created, the entire
OM CCB will timeout and be aborted. This could make desirable
and correct configuration changes impossible to commit/apply. 

The saImmOiAugmentCcbInitialize call also returns 'ownerHandle'. 
This admin owner handle is initialized to the same admin-owner
used by the originating OM client. It can be used by the OI to
set admin-owner for objects the OI intends to modify or delete
and where it does not know that the admin-owner is already set
by the originating OM client, (create operations always get
admin-owner set automatically as part of creation). 
The 'ownerHandle' always has 'releaseOwnershipOnFinalize set to
true. This is the case even if the original admin owner has it set
to false. The release of the OI augmented admin-owner is done when
the root CCB commits (is applied). The admin-owner can not be 
released when the augmented ccb is applied because the augmented
operations are still pending the apply of the root ccb. 

The OI designer needs to understand that if they set admin-owner
on some objects which already have admin owner set by the original
OM user and the original OM user has releaseOnFinalize as false,
then the OI will cause a release of admin-owner on these objects
which could be a 'surprise' (cause problems) for the OM user.

Again, the OI designer intending to augment CCBs needs to think
carefully about what they are trying to do and why, to avoid
creating an application that appears unmanagable.


Support for SA_IMM_CCB_ALLOW_NULL_OI (4.2)
=========================================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1997

OpenSAF 4.2 exteds the SaImmCcbFlagsT type with a new flag value:

  #define SA_IMM_CCB_ALLOW_NULL_OI 0x0000000000000100

This flag is available for OI clients that register with 
imm version A.2.11. 

The flag should be set in *combination* with the existing
SA_IMM_CCB_REGISTERED_OI flag. Its effect is that it relaxes
the requirement on OI to allow no registered OI when there
is no registered implementer *name* for the class/object.
If an implementer name exists, but no implemener is currently
attached, then the semantics is still the same as 
SA_IMM_CCB_REGISTERED_OI, the CCB operation is rejected with
SA_AIS_ERR_NOT_EXIST.

This will be the setting hardwired into commands such as 'immcfg'
when invokde in safe mode.

There are then 3 possible flag settings for saImmOmCcbinitialize:

No flags: Allow CCBs to proceed despite missing OIs, regardless
of the way they are missing. This variant is the most unsafe and
should really only be used by special applications such as
immloader. The danger is that an OI that is only temporarily
detached, say during a failover, will not get the opportunity
to validate the CCB. This setting is typically too unsafe.

SA_IMM_CCB_REGISTERED_OI: See the IMM spec for A.02.01.
A CCB operation on an object will only be allowed when there
is an OI name registered for it AND the OI is attached.
This is the most safe way of executing a CCB, but it may be
too restrictive in some cases. The best example is during
installation when some config objects are created before
the OI is started. 

SA_IMM_CCB_REGISTERED_OI | SA_IMM_CCB_ALLOW_NULL_OI: 
This is the relatively safe variant in the middle.
A CCB operation on an object is allowed if there is an 
implementer, or if there is no implementer name defined
for the object.


Support for the environment variable IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT (4.2)
=============================================================
http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1808

The IMMA libraries (both OM and OI) have a hard-wired timeout
on syncronous downcalls (to the IMMND), of 10 seconds.

This enhancement changes that to a default timeout, with the
option for the IMMA client to override the default by setting a
value for the environment variable:

            IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT.

The unit of time is 10 milliseconds. Thus the default value 
for IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT is 1000 (10 seconds). The minimum allowed
value is 10 (0.1 seconds). Trying to set a value less than 10
will only be interpreted as the value 10. 

The 10 second default timeout is a compromize. It is very long for
some applications to be blocked for up to 10 seconds, for example
many OIs can get in trouble with such a long wait.

For other applications, 10 seconds is too short, for example
"immcfg -f huge-batch.xml" with PBE enabled can get ERR_TIMEOUT
during apply (http://devel.opensaf.org/ticket/1786).

Applications with relatively tight realtime restrictions can set 
IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT to a low value, avoiding the risk of getting
blocked for 10 seconds, but with an increased risk of getting
ERR_TIMEOUT on syncronous calls.

Some batch operations, particularly deletes of large subtrees of
imm data, where one delete downcall is expanded into a cascade of
deletes of objects in the subtree, can benefit from setting 
a high value on IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT.

The IMMA library samples the IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT environment variable
at OM/OI handle initialize. The handle is stamped with the value of
of IMMA_SYNCR_TIMEOUT (if it exists), at the time of handle create.

This means that the timeout can not be altered for every individual
downcall. But it also means that one process may have different 
timeouts set for different handles. Sub-handles (ccb, admin-owner,
iteration, accessor) inherit the timeout value of their associated
om-handle.

STATE MACHINES

There are two state machines that control important aspects of the IMMND
behaviour.

The ImmNodeState in immModel.cc governs the accessibility of the data model of
the IMM at each node.

    typedef enum {

        IMM_NODE_UNKNOWN = 0,         /*Initial state */
        IMM_NODE_LOADING = 1,         /* Participating in a cluster restart */
        IMM_NODE_FULLY_AVAILABLE = 2, /* Normal fully available state */
        IMM_NODE_ISOLATED = 3,        /* Trying to join an established cluster*/
        IMM_NODE_W_AVAILABLE = 4,     /* We are being synced, No model reads
                                         allowed */
        IMM_NODE_R_AVAILABLE = 5      /* Write locked while other nodes are
                                         being synced. No model writes allowed*/
    } ImmNodeState;

  Transitions:

    IMM_NODE_UNKNOWN -(StartLoading)-> IMM_NODE_LOADING
    IMM_NODE_LOADING -(LoadingSuccess)->IMM_NODE_FULLY_AVAILABLE
    IMM_NODE_UNKNOWN -(MissedLoading)-> IMM_NODE_ISOLATED
    IMM_NODE_ISOLATED-(StartSync)->IMM_NODE_W_AVAILABLE
    IMM_NODE_W_AVAILABLE-(SyncSuccess)->IMM_NODE_FULLY_AVAILABLE
    IMM_NODE_FULLY_AVAILABLE->(StartSync)->IMM_NODE_R_AVAILABLE
    IMM_NODE_R_AVAILABLE->(SyncTerminate)->IMM_NODE_FULLY_AVAILABLE


The IMMND_SERVER_STATE in immnd_cb.h and immnd_proc.c governs the progress of
cluster level tasks. In particular the behaviour of the coordinator, and
non-coordinators during loading and sync.

    typedef enum immnd_server_state {

        IMM_SERVER_UNKNOWN         = 0, /* Not allowed. Not used */
        IMM_SERVER_ANONYMOUS       = 1, /* Initial state */
        IMM_SERVER_CLUSTER_WAITING = 2, /* Waiting for expected #nodes */
        IMM_SERVER_LOADING_PENDING = 3, /* Waiting for loading to start */
        IMM_SERVER_LOADING_SERVER  = 4, /* Coord is executing loading */
        IMM_SERVER_LOADING_CLIENT  = 5, /* Not coord, receive loading */
        IMM_SERVER_SYNC_PENDING    = 6, /* Not coord, load impossible, wait for
                                           sync*/
        IMM_SERVER_SYNC_CLIENT     = 7, /* Not coord, this node is being
                                           synced */
        IMM_SERVER_SYNC_SERVER     = 8, /* Coord, executing sync */
        IMM_SERVER_DUMP            = 9, /* Not used */
        IMM_SERVER_READY           = 10 /* Coord & Not coord. Normal idle
                                           state.*/

    }IMMND_SERVER_STATE;

    IMM_SERVER_SYNC_CLIENT-(sync succeeded)->IMM_SERVER_READY
    IMM_SERVER_SYNC_SERVER-(sync terminated)->IMM_SERVER_READY


OTHER IMPLEMENTATION POINTS

There is an epoch-count maintained by the IMMD. The epoch count is incremented
cluster-wide by the coordinator after important events such as: loading 
completed, sync completed and dump completed. The epoch count is stored
persistently in every dump so that a re-load using that dump will be starting
from the saved epoch. 

The central data model of the IMMND is implemented in C++ and uses STL (Standard
Template Library) collections to represent the data model. 
Other parts of IMMND are implemented in C.

The immload and immdump programs are implemented in C++. These programs 
communicate with the IMMSv using the IMM-OM API. They use libxml2 to parse and
generate the imm.xml format. 

The IMMA library is implemented in C.

The IMMD is implemented in C.



CONFIGURATION

See OpenSAF_IMMSv_PR.

COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

See OpenSAF_IMMSv_PR.

DEBUG

To enable/disable immd/immnd trace in a running system, send signal USR2 to the
immd/immnd process. Each signal toggles the trace.
Trace default is disabled.

Traces are written to the file configured in immd.conf and immnd.conf

To enable traces from the very start, uncomment:

        #args="--tracemask=0xffffffff"

in immd.conf/immnd.conf and restart the cluster.

Errors, warnings and notice level messages are logged to the syslog.

To enable traces in the IMM library, export the variable IMMA_TRACE_PATHNAME
with a valid pathname before starting the application using the IMM library.

For example:

$ export IMMA_TRACE_PATHNAME=/tmp/imm.trace
$ ./immomtest
$ cat /tmp/imm.trace


It is also possible to trace slave processes forked by the IMMND.
This would be processes for loading, sync and dump/pbe.
To enable such trace uncomment:

	#export IMMSV_TRACE_PATHNAME=$pkglogdir/osafimmnd


TEST

Currently a "tetware like" test suite can be found in 'tests/immsv/'. 
See tests/immsv/README for instructions.
