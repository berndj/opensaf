GENERAL
CLMSv is an implementation of the SAF-AIS-CLM-B.04.01 specifications.

This document provides an overview of the design and internals of the CLMSv.
The CLMSv service is implemented as the following modules:
	* CLMS - The Cluster Membership Server
	* CLMNA - The Cluster Membership Node Agent
	* CLMA - The Cluster Membership Agent

The CLMS server is implemented as a server process running on the OpenSAF
controller nodes in a 2N redundancy model.

The CLMNA is an CLM node agent process that gets started on every node during
OpenSAF node startup. The CLMNA fetches the saClmNode(node name)of the local node,
the saClmNodeID(/etc/opensaf/node_id a "run time" attribute) 
(and in future, the saClmNodeCurrAddressFamily  and saClmNodeCurrAddress "run time"attributes
of the saClmNode class) and updates the CLMS.
The CLMNA is modelled as component in a NoRedundancy Model with error recovery
as NodeFailFast.

The CLMA is the clm agent library that user applications shall link with.
