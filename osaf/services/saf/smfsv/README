GENERAL
=======
This directory (smfsv) contains an implementation of the SAF SMF service
version A.01.02.

The SMF service is implemented as a director process (smfd) executing on the controllers
using a 2N redundancy model and a node director (smfnd) process executing on all nodes 
without redundancy. The node director is a helper process used by the director when
a command needs to be executed on a specific node (e.g. bundle install/remove scripts).
In the future the smfnd is intended to also support handling of SMF callbacks.

The smfd is the process that is the IMM-OI for the campaigns and executes the actual 
upgrade campaign. Only one campaign can be executed at the time.
When the admin operation execute is called on a campaign object a campaign thread is 
started that will execute the campaign. The campaign thread will parse the campaign 
xml file and create upgrade procedure threads for each procedure in the campaign. 
The procedure threads will in turn be executed by sending an execute message to them. 
Within the procedure thread each upgrade step will be executed in sequence. Between
each step in the procedure the execution is interrupted and a message is sent to the 
procedure thread to execute the next step. This is done so that it'll be possible to 
send a suspend message to the procedure thread to interrupt the execution. 

The design is intended to handle cases where the smfd needs to move between the two
controllers in the middle of an campaign execution e.g. when upgrading opensaf itself.
It's even thought to handle an upgrade where the whole cluster is rebooting in the
middle of the campaign e.g. OS upgrade on all nodes at the same time.
This is acheived by storing information only in the IMM instead of using e.g. the CKPT 
service.

============
smfsv depends of the following other OpenSAF services:
- IMM
- NTF
- AMF
- MDS
- LEAP
- logtrace

DATA STRUCTURES
===============
smfd uses the following data structures:

- Control block. Statically allocated, one instance. Access through a global
pointer variable.

smfnd uses the following data structures:

- Control block. Statically allocated. Access through a global variable. 
The control block contains list of registered SMF callbacks (future).


STATE MACHINES
==============
There are three state machines defined in the SMF specification.
-Campaign state machine
-Procedure state machine
-Step state machine

Implemented campaign states:
   SA_SMF_CMPG_INITIAL =1,
   SA_SMF_CMPG_EXECUTING = 2,
   SA_SMF_CMPG_EXECUTION_COMPLETED = 5,
   SA_SMF_CMPG_CAMPAIGN_COMMITTED = 6,
   SA_SMF_CMPG_EXECUTION_FAILED = 10,

Implemented procedure states:
   SA_SMF_PROC_INITIAL =1,
   SA_SMF_PROC_EXECUTING = 2,
   SA_SMF_PROC_COMPLETED = 4,
   SA_SMF_PROC_FAILED = 6,

Implemented step states:
   SA_SMF_STEP_INITIAL =1,
   SA_SMF_STEP_EXECUTING = 2,
   SA_SMF_STEP_COMPLETED = 4,
   SA_SMF_STEP_FAILED = 6,

State machines follows the state design pattern described in "Design Patterns,
ISBN 0-201-63361-2".


ADMINISTRATIVE API
==================
The SaSmfCampaign object accepts administrative operations.
The follwing admin operations are implemented:
   SA_SMF_ADMIN_EXECUTE = 1,
   SA_SMF_ADMIN_SUSPEND = 3,
   SA_SMF_ADMIN_COMMIT  = 4

CONFIGURATION
=============
The following environment variables are required:


The following environment variables are optional and a default value will be
used by SMFSV if not configured


SMF ADAPTATION COMMANDS
=======================
Smf is delivered with default implementations of the adaptation commands
  smf_backup_create
  smf_backup_restore
  smf_repository_check
  smf_bundle_check
  smf_node_check
  smf_bundle_import
  smf_bundle_remove
  smf_cluster_reboot

The default implementations are simple examples woking on an OpenSAF reference configuration.
These commands must typically be reimplemented to fit the customer system running OpenSAF. 

SMF excpects some services to be available during execution. These services are 
called SMF adaptation commands.
By default sample interface commands are installed as below: 

The default implementation of the commands needed by SMF in runtime are located as below:
/usr/local/lib/opensaf/smf_repository_check
/usr/local/lib/opensaf/smf_node_check
/usr/local/lib/opensaf/smf_cluster_reboot
/usr/local/lib/opensaf/smf_bundle_check
/usr/local/lib/opensaf/smf_backup_create

The locations of the specific implementations are pointed out by the SMF configuration
object described below. To override the default implementations appropriate attributes must be 
set to point to the new locations (see chapter SMF CONFIGURATION).

SMF CONFIGURATION
=================
SMF configuration data is kept by the SMF configuration class "smfConfig". The DN of the 
configuration object is "smfConfig=1,safApp=safSmfService".

Example below:
# immlist smfConfig=1,safApp=safSmfService
Name                                               Type         Value(s)

SMF is included in the following RPM's
opensaf-samples-x.x.x
opensaf-controller-x.x.x
opensaf-payload-x.x.x

COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
======================
-

DEBUG
=====
To enable/disable log server traces in a running system, send signal USR2 to the
smfd/smfnd process. Every time the trace state is toggled.

Traces are written to the file:

	$pkglogdir/osafsmfd.log
	$pkglogdir/osafsmfnd.log

To enable traces from the very start of the smf server, uncomment the line:

        #args="--tracemask=0xffffffff"

in smfd.conf and/or smfnd.conf (see CONFIGURATION above) and restart the system.

For fatal errors and notices about the execution the syslog is used.


TEST
====
To run campaigns in UML environment see the README file in
directory "samples/smfsv"
