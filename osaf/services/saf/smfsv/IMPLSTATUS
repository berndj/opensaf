
This document describes the implementation status of this release.

High level summary
------------------
Not planned to be implemented in OpenSAF4.0 release:
-Rollback.

Implemented:
-Rolling upgrade including targetNodeTemplate and targetEntityTemplate.        
-Single step upgrade including actedOn/byTemplate and targetEntutyTemplate.

The chapters below refers to the SAI-AIS-SMF-A.01.02 specification.

3 System Description and System Model 
3.2.2.1 Repository Management 
        No bundle import function implemented, manual procedure.
        No bundle remove function implemented, manual procedure.
	No bundle check function implemented, specific for each adaptation.
	For demo purpuses dummy scripts can be found:
	-in devel tree a "OpenSAFroot/services/smfsv/interface_commands"
	-on target at "/usr/local/lib/opensaf/".

3.2.3 Software Installation and Uninstallation
      Implemented. 
      SMF will run installation/revoval commands found in the SaSmfSwBundle 
      object(s) pointed out by the campaign xml file.

      For demo use, dummy installation/removal commands are provided in directory
      "OpenSAFroot/samples/smf" . 
      These commands:
      -offline_install.sh  
      -offline_remove.sh  
      -online_install.sh  
      -online_remove.sh
      must be manually copied to a location pointed out by the SaSmfSwBundle object(s).
      In the sample UML cluster comfiguration (imm.xml) the software bundle will point out
      directory "/hostfs".

3.2.3.1 Ordering of the Operations for Upgrade
	Implemented.

3.2.3.2 Ordering of the Operations for Recovery
	Not implemented.

4 Failure Detection and Failure Handling
4.1 Failure Detection
    Implemented:
    -The Software Management Framework must evaluate the result of each individual
    action performed, such as the success or failure of a CLI operation during an
    upgrade step.
    Not implemeted:
    -The Software Management Framework must evaluate the results reported back
    by registered processes of upgrade-aware entities. These are processes that
    register with the Software Management Framework to be called back during the
    upgrade campaign under certain circumstances (see Section 6.1.1.4).
    -The Software Management Framework must monitor the operational state
    change notifications generated by the Availability Management Framework that
    indicate that the disabled entity was involved in a maintenance campaign.
    -The Software Management Framework may monitor other notifications and
    alarms in the system to correlate them with the actions performed by the campaign.

4.1.1 Upgrade Prerequisites
      Implemented:
      1. The Software Management Framework is operational.
      2. The software repository is accessible.
      3. There is no other upgrade campaign in progress.
      Not implemented:
      4. The currently running version of the software is available in the software repository.
      5. The specifics of the upgrade campaign have been provided, and the campaign is
         still applicable.
      6. The desired version of the software is available in the software repository, and all
         the dependencies of the required packages have been checked and are satisfied.
      7. All affected nodes must provide the resources (for instance, sufficient disk space
         and proper access rights) needed to perform the upgrade campaign.
      8. The target system is in a state such that the expected service outage does not
         exceed the acceptable service outage defined for the campaign.
      9. Upgrade-aware entities are ready for an upgrade campaign.
      10.Any necessary backup is created.

4.1.2 Upgrade Step Verification
      Implemented:
      -Actions that return their result immediately (for instance, CLI commands for the
      installation), and this result is directly applicable to the upgrade step within which
      it is performed (see Section 4.1.5). The Software Management Framework can
      use this return value immediately to decide about the outcome of the upgrade
      step.
      Not implemented:
      -Actions that do not return their result immediately. The Software Management
      Framework needs to rely on the error reports propagated by the Notification Service.
      These notifications and alarms may occur with some delay; therefore, the
      failures they report are referred to as asynchronous failures and are handled at
      the campaign level.

4.1.3 Upgrade Procedure Verification
      Implemented i.e. specified wrapup actions are executed.

4.1.4 Upgrade Campaign Verification
      Implemented i.e. campCompleteAction is executed after the procedures
                       campWrapupAction is executed at commit operation.

4.2 Failure Handling
4.2.1 Protective Measures
      Implemented:
      -Backup. The backup command ia always called in the beginning of an upgrade campaign.
       A reference implementation of a backup command is delivered in OpenSAF. The implementation 
       of the backup command suitable for the actual system must be done by the user.
      Not implemented:
      -Upgrade history.

4.2.1.1 Backup 
	SMF calls the backup command found in the smfConfig object. A reference backup implementation is 
	delivered.

E.g.

# immlist smfConfig=1,safApp=safSmfService
Name                                               Type         Value(s)

	  Implemented.

6.4.2.1.2 Activation Unit Template
	  Imlemented.
	  Note: If two (or more) SG parent elements are entered. The SUs found will end up in separate

<activationUnitTemplate>
	<type objectDN="dn=dn1"></type>
	<parent objectDN="dn=dn2"></parent>
	<type objectDN="dn=dn3"></type>
	<parent objectDN="dn=dn4"></parent>
	<parent objectDN="dn=dn5"></parent>
	<type objectDN="dn=dn6"></type>
	<type objectDN="dn=dn7"></type>
</activationUnitTemplate>

Dn1 = single type

Dn4 = single parent
Dn5/dn6 = parent/type pair
Dn7 = single type

	<type objectDN="dn=dn3"></type>
        <modifyOperation>
            ...
        </modifyOperation>
</targetEntityTemplate>
<targetEntityTemplate>
	<parent objectDN="dn=dn4"></type>

Non standard step implementation
--------------------------------

Besides the two standardized set of actions within a step (standard and reduced) 
additional action sets are provided to make it possible to:
-install SW which requires reboot to install/uninstall
-install SW on e.g. RAM disk based clusters which support prepare and activate functionality.

A) Step actions supporting SW which requires reboot to install/uninstall
   This set of actions are triggerd by the bundle object attributes saSmfBundleInstallOfflineScope
   and saSmfBundleRemoveOfflineScope. If any of these attributes are set to SA_SMF_CMD_SCOPE_PLM_EE(4)
   this set of actions will be entered. 
   The set of actions are as below:
   1)-Online installation of new software (all new bundles)
   2)-Lock deactivation unit
   3)-Terminate deactivation unit
   4)-Offline uninstallation of old software (all old bundles)
   5)-Modify information model and set maintenance status
------inner step-----------
   6)-If any SW bundle to install have the attribute saSmfBundleInstallOfflineScope set to SA_SMF_CMD_SCOPE_PLM_EE
      *reboot node
   7)-If any SW bundle to remove have the attribute saSmfBundleRemoveOfflineScope set to SA_SMF_CMD_SCOPE_PLM_EE
      *Online uninstallation for those bundles.
      *reboot node
------end of inner step----
   8)-Offline installation of new software (all new bundles)
   9)-Instantiate activation unit
  10)-Unlock activation unit
  11)-Online uninstallation (of all old SW bunles which have NOT set the saSmfBundleRemoveOfflineScope 
      to SA_SMF_CMD_SCOPE_PLM_EE)

Note: Typically SW which requires reboot only have online scripts. The procedure above allows steps
      with mixed types of SW bundles. The only addition to the standard set of actions are 6, 7 and modified 11.
      A "reboot" set of actions requires the AU/DU to be on node level.


B) Step actions supporting RAM disk based clusters which support prepare and activate functionality.
   These sets of actions are triggered by the attribute "smfNodeBundleActCmd" in the  SMF configuration 
   object "SmfConfig". If this attribute is set, a new set of actions will be used. The value of the 
   attribute shall point out the command to be used for activation of the queued installation/removal
   tasks.

   Full set of actions for non restartable units:
   1)-Online installation of new software (all new bundles)
   2)-Lock deactivation unit
   3)-Terminate deactivation unit
   4)-Offline uninstallation of old software (all old bundles)
   5)-Modify information model and set maintenance status
   6)-Offline installation of new software (all new bundles)
   7)-Online uninstallation (all old bundles)
   8)-If any SW bundle to install have the attribute saSmfBundleInstallOfflineScope or 
      saSmfBundleRemoveOfflineScope set to SA_SMF_CMD_SCOPE_PLM_EE
         *reboot node (activation is assumed to be a part of the reboot)
      else
         *Activate installations/uninstallations using the command given in the "smfNodeBundleActCmd" attribute.
   9)-Instantiate activation unit
  10)-Unlock activation unit

Note: A "reboot" path requires the AU/DU to be on node level.

   Reduced set of actions for restartable units:
   1)-Online installation of new software (all new bundles)
   2)-Modify information model and set maintenance status
   3)-Online uninstallation (all old bundles)
   4)-Activate installations/uninstallations using the command given in the "smfNodeBundleActCmd" attribute.
   5)-Restart symetric activation unit.
