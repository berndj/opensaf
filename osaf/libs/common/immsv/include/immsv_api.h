 *
 * The second includes cached attributes even when there is no implementer
 * currently. An implementer that re-attaches after a failure may continue
 * with the cached value provided by its predecessor (i.e. not change it).
 * It is then important that the sync has fetched this value even when there
 * is no implementer. A normal iteration will exclude such values.
 *
 * The use of these flags in search options is NON STANDARD.
 * It is only allowed for imm internal use. 
 * We are messing with the a part of the value space for search options.
 * This may not be possible in future implementations.
 *
 * The defines should really not use the SA_IMM prefix as they are non
 * standard. But I choose use the same prefix as the corrsponding defines
 * in the standard, as a reminder of where I am tresspassing. 
 * This includefile is not part of the public API anyway.
