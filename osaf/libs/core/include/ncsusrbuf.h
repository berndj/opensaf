  USRBUFs may need to come from specific memory areas to better accomodate
  particular transport services. 

  This USRBUF Layer Management interface allows a target system to 'bind' a
  particular pool_id to a set of malloc/free routines. This binding would
  typically happen at system initialization time.

  Note that the default implementation has a set of preconfigured memory
  pools built right in and will not allow one to register on top of those
  pre-assigned pools.

  At runtime, clients that need to use specific memory from a specific pool
  will request memory by pool_id. The USRBUF facilities will use this value
  to determine which malloc function to call. A USRBUF will track where
  the memory came from so it is returned to the proper pool.

   Memory Supply Priority Scheme 
 
  Conceptually, pools may have limited resources and that should be used
  wisely. Accordingly, requestors should rank their need against the 
  'common health and welfare' of the entire system by fairly characterizing
  the urgency of their request using the priority scheme below.
 
  NCSMEM_HI_PRI    If mem available, provide it
  NCSMEM_MED_PRI   If conserving mem and low (say 15%), don't provide it
  NCSMEM_LOW_PRI   if conserving mem and low (say 30%), don't provide it
 
  NOTE: To date (6/2001)....
  - Most NetPlane subsystems shall submit HI_PRI requests by default, as
  they are not currently sensitive to these differences.
  - No NetPlane reference implementations make decisions based on priority.
  It is provided so that customers may implement such distinctions, if
  needed.
  - The notion of 15% and 30% as percent ranges is for example purposes
  and may not reflect what may be appropriate for any particular system.
