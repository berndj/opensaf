  DESCRIPTION: Abstractions and APIs for NCS_HDL service, an access-safe,
  use-safe means to fetch and use fleeting and/or volitile objects.

  Abstractions and APIs for the 'Local Persistence Guard' service which is
  also an access-safe, use-safe mens to fetch and use a fleeting object
  that happens to live off another object. It provides that same type of
  protection as the Handle Manager, but does not require the de-coupling
  of handle and object.

  G O A L :

  - Guarentees that an object will not be destroyed by another thread while
    a take()r has the object but has not give()n it back.

  - IF the object take()n has critical regions that must be guarded (linked
    lists and the like), it is up to the take()r to employ its own locking
    scheme.

  R U L E S :

  - Hdl Mgr will allow any number of take()r threads to have the data at 
    the same time. This increments a refcount.

  - A take()r will fail if the handle referenced has been destroy()ed or is
    in the process of being destroy()ed.

  - A successful take()r must give() back when done. This decriments 
    a refcount.
  
  - A destroy()er thread shall be blocked if the refcount of the handle is
    greater than one. When the refcount is one, the destroy()er thread 
    is unblocked, the object is removed and the handle is destroyed.
    
     WARNING: Failure to give() for every take() will cause an infinite 
              blocking of the remove()r's thread!!!

  D E A D L O C K   I S S U E :

  - The general algorythm used to avoid deadlock in a subsystem is as 
    follows:

    1) take()   the object using the handle
    2) lock()   access to the object according to subsystem rules.
    3) unlock() the object 
    4) give()   the object (decriment refcnt) using the handle

  - This should be no problem for any subsystems that uses the Hdl Mgr from
    the start, as the Hdl Mgr serves as the primary means to access objects.

  - Legacy subsystems, that already have locks and access mechanisms in
    place are more likely to run into deadlock, as the Hdl Mgr is used for
    a subset of its object access issues while the existing object access
    scheme is used by the bulk of the code. In such cases, a deadlock can
    easily arrise when one thread utilizes the sequence expressed above while
    another thread uses the sequence below...

    A) lock()    acess to the object according to subsystem rules
    B) destroy() the handle using the lock

    If thread dualing causes the sequence to go 1 - A - B - 2...
    
    Then there is deadlock, since:
    - B will freeze waiting for the the give() which was take()n at 1 and 
    - 2 will freeze waiting to get the lock secured at A.

  Handle Pools
    
    The Handle Manager comes pre-configured with 9 pools. See ncs_hdl.c for
    table and sizes (other pool numbers and breakdown sizes can be configured). 

    The zeroeth pool is intended for local services such as MDS and has a
    relatively low number of unique handle names at about 2.1 million.

    The other 8 pools each have about 33.5 million handle names each.

  Sharing Handle Names between Primary and Backup

    A Handle manager handle can map to the same object in different memory
    spaces that are set up for redundancy as follows:

    1 - The Primary and Backup sides agree to use the same Handle Manager
        pool Ids in both places, scoped by their common VCARD id value.

    2 - Pools with the same ID must be the same shape (have the same name 
        space) across these two different memory spaces.

    3 - The primary side ALWAYS invokes ncshm_create_hdl() to get a handle.

    4 - A backup, typically at checkpoint data arrival time shall ALWAYS
        invoke ncshm_declare_hdl() to DECLARE to the handle manager what 
        handle value it MUST have for this particular object.

    NOTE: A Handle Manager client must have the discipline to keep the
    correlation between Primary-CREATE-handle-to-object mapping 1-to-1 with 
    the Backup-DECLARE-handle-to-object.

    NOTE: By following these rules, the Handle Manager SHOULD NOT run
    into a name clash (declared name already in-use) at ncshm_declare_hdl()
    time.

  L P G : Local Persistence Guard

  G O A L :

  - Provide the same object persistence guarentees as the Handle Manger, but
    at a cheaper cost, in those cases where an 'anchor object' is known to
    exist, and the thing-that-must-be-persistent is embedded or hanging off
    of this known anchor object.

  - Guarentees that an object will not be destroyed by another thread while
    a take()r has the object but has not give()n it back.

  - IF the object take()n has critical regions that must be guarded (linked
    lists and the like), it is up to the take()r to employ its own locking
    scheme.

  R U L E S :

  - LPG will allow any number of take()r threads to have the data at 
    the same time. This increments a refcount.

  - A take()r will fail if the referenced thing has been destroy()ed or is
    in the process of being destroy()ed.

  - A successful take()r must give() back when done. This decriments 
    a refcount.
  
  - A destroy()er thread shall be blocked if the refcount of the handle is
    greater than one. When the refcount is one, the destroy()er thread 
    is unblocked, the object not removed, but set to 'closed' state, thus
    assuring that future 'take()rs will not be allowed to enter.
    
     WARNING: Failure to give() for every take() will cause an infinite 
              blocking of the remove()r's thread!!!

  D E A D L O C K   I S S U E :

  - See notes for the Hdl Manager, as they apply here as well.

  C O M M O N   H A N D L E S  @ P R I M A R Y   A N D   B A C K U P

  - LPG 'locks' are only ever local. This category of functionality does
    not exist.
