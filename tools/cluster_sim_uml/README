WHAT IS THIS?

This directory (and subdirectories) contains a User Mode Linux - UML simulated
cluster environment for opensaf. Default a five node cluster will be started, 
two controller nodes and three payload nodes.

The cluster environment is built using:
- Linux kernel
- Busybox
- opensaf rpms
- a few host libraries

All packages are downloaded from the net. Make sure to have proxy settings
(http_proxy variable) correct if needed. Downloaded packages are stored in
the 'archive' subdirectories. Downloading the Linux kernel can take some
time, select a HTTP server closer to you if that is an issue.

For minimising the memory requirements for each UML instance, the major part
of its root file system consists of links to files on the host file
system. This concept is called a shadow root, see below.

See the README file in the uml subdirectory for more information about UML.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

$OSAF_UML_EXTRA
	  If this environment variable is set, it points to a directory
	  containing compressed tar archives to be extracted into the guest file
	  system. This is useful if you want to customise your UML guests by
	  adding extra programs, or replace programs or libraries with your own
	  versions that may be different from the ones installed on the host
	  system.

archive	  This directory contains a number of configuration files for the
	  cluster. The 'scripts' subdirectory contains the init scripts that 
	  are executed during UML startup. The scripts are copied from this 
	  directory to the shadow root by the build system. Do not edit.

bin	  This directory contains shell scripts used during the installation
	  and to start the cluster.
	  Users: Do not edit.
	  Maintainers: The install.sh script is sensitive to changes in the
	  opensaf rpm spec files. This script is written this way so that a
	  non root user can build. Otherwise 'rpm -i --root=..' could have been
	  used.

etc	  This directory contains a script that this executed very early in
	  the UML startup. It is required by the fairly generic UML scripts to
	  be located here. Do not edit.

uml	  This directory contains the UML kernel build, the busybox build and
	  UML utilities.


HOW TO BUILD

When the UML root file system is generated it will use 'make install' with
DESTDIR set to the UML root file system. Make sure you have a default 
configured Opensaf like this:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DRUNASROOT

- Execute './build_uml'.

Building means downloading, configuring & building packages from the
internet, creating shadow a root file system for OpenSAF nodes.
When 'build_uml' is executed a second time, only the shadow root file systems
are recreated.

Files created and generated are removed by 'clean_uml'. Files downloaded from
the internet are not deleted. They have to be manually deleted from uml/archive
to start from scratch.

Building adds the following direcories:

rootfs	   This directory contains a shadow root direcory for
		   controller and payload nodes. Do not edit.


HOW TO RUN

To start the cluster, either from XML or persistent store

   ./opensaf start [number of nodes]

To stop the cluster:

   ./opensaf stop

To clean persistent store:

   ./opensaf clean

When the persistent store is cleaned, the next start will be from XML.

Default memory size for each blade is 128M. You can change this using the
environment variable OSAF_UML_MEMSIZE, e.g.:

    export OSAF_UML_MEMSIZE=256M

Running the cluster adds the following direcories:

repl-opensaf	This directory contains a simulated shared replicated disk
	partition. It is used to store opensaf configurations and log files.

	Soft links are created from directories in the shadow root file system
	into this directory.

rootfs/var/<node name>	This directory is the node unique '/var'
			  directory. It contains e.g. the system log from each
			  node, stdouts for the components, core dumps and so on.


STARTUP SEQUENCE

1. A number of uml/bin/linux instances are started, each in its own
   xterm. Each UML instance is given a unique command line e.g. hostname which
   is the same as the node name in the XML configuration.

2. /sbin/init is executed and reads /etc/inittab, executes the 'sysinit' entry
   (/etc/init.d/rcS)

3. /etc/init.d/rcS executes /hostfs/etc/init.d/umlprep (etc/init.d/umlprep)

4. /etc/init.d/rcS unpacks the shadow root cpio archive

5. /etc/init.d/rcS executes /etc/init.d/*.rc (archive/scripts/*)
   in numerical order.

6. controller	
   /etc/init.d/40opensaf.rc does the following:
   - setups the environment for opensaf 
   - executes '/etc/init.d/opensafd start'

6. payload
   /etc/init.d/40opensaf.rc does the following:
   - setups the environment for opensaf 
   - executes '/etc/init.d/opensafd start'


NETWORKING

The cluster environment uses the UML utility 'uml_switch' to create an
isolated network for the UML instances. 'uml_switch' is a process that
implements a virtual switch using a UNIX domain socket.

It is not possible to communicate between the host and an UML instance with
this network setup. If host network access is required, please read UML
documentation.


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI)

To access the opensaf CLI, first switch to the super user using the 'su' command.
Then start the CLI with: 'ncs_cli_maa'. Online help is provided and to exit the
CLI use the command 'clishut'.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

UML should run on any 2.6 host kernel. If the host kernel is patched for SKAS3
mode, you will get better guest (UML) kernel performance.

32 and 64 bit are verified.

GNU C Library version 2.4 or later

The following packages are known to work:

- bash-3.1-24.4 (needed by opensaf scripts)
- readline-5.1-24.4 (needed by bash)
- ncurses-5.5-18.2 (needed by bash)
- libgcc-4.1.0-28.4 (needed by scap)
- libstdc++-4.1.0-28.4 (needed by scap)
